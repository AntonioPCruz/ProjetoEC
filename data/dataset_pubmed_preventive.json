    "abstract": "Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among males 15 to 34 years of age, with an estimated 8,850 new cases and 410 deaths during 2017 in the United States. With effective treatment, the overall five-year survival rate is 97%. Risk factors for testicular cancer include undescended testis (cryptorchidism), personal or family history of testicular cancer, age, ethnicity, and infertility. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening in asymptomatic men. Men with symptoms should receive a complete history and physical examination. Scrotal ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging study. If a solid intratesticular mass is discovered, orchiectomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Staging through chest radiography, chemistry panel, liver function tests, and tumor markers guides treatment. Active surveillance, chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy are treatment options following orchiectomy. For patients desiring future fertility, sperm banking should be discussed early in the course of treatment. Family physicians often play a role in the care of cancer survivors and should be familiar with monitoring for recurrence and future complications, including secondary malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular risk, and infertility and subfertility.",

    "abstract": "Numerous reporting guidelines are available to help authors write higher-quality papers more efficiently. Almost 200 are listed on the EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research) Network's website and they vary in authority, usability, and breadth, making it difficult to decide which one(s) to use. This paper provides consistent information about guidelines for preventive medicine and public health and a framework and sequential approach for selecting them. The EQUATOR guidelines were reviewed for relevance to target audiences; selected guidelines were classified as \"core\" (frequently recommended) or specialized, and the latter were grouped by their focus. Core and specialized guidelines were coded for indicators of authority (simultaneous publication in multiple journals, rationale, scientific background supporting each element, expertise of designers, permanent website/named group), usability (presence of checklists and examples of good reporting), and breadth (article sections covered). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Selected guidelines are presented in four tables arranged to facilitate selection: core guidelines, all of which pertain to major research designs; guidelines for additional study designs; topical guidelines; and guidelines for particular article sections. A flow diagram provides an overview. The framework and sequential approach will enable authors as well as editors, peer reviewers, researchers, and systematic reviewers to make optimal use of available guidelines to improve the transparency, clarity, and rigor of manuscripts and research protocols and the efficiency in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.",

    "title": "Screening for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force",
    "abstract": "Importance: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a spinal curvature of 10° or more, is the most common form of scoliosis, with a prevalence of 1% to 3%. Curves progress in approximately two-thirds of patients with AIS before skeletal maturity, and large curves (>50°) may be associated with adverse health outcomes.\nObjective: To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of AIS screening for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\nData sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, ERIC, PubMed, CINAHL, and relevant systematic reviews were searched for studies published from January 1966 to October 20, 2016; studies included in a previous USPSTF report were also reviewed. Surveillance was conducted through July 24, 2017.\nStudy selection: Fair- and good-quality studies that evaluated the accuracy of screening children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years for AIS, the benefits of AIS treatment, the harms of AIS screening or treatment, or long-term health outcomes.\nData extraction and synthesis: Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data into evidence tables. Results were qualitatively summarized.\nMain outcomes and measures: Health outcomes and spinal curvature in adolescence and adulthood, accuracy of screening for AIS, any harm of AIS screening or treatment.\nResults: Fourteen studies (N = 448 276) in 26 articles were included. Accuracy of AIS screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity; 99.2% specificity) in a cohort study of a clinic-based program using forward bend test, scoliometer, and Moiré topography screening (n = 306 082); accuracy was lower in cohort studies of 6 programs using fewer modalities (n = 141 161). Four controlled studies (n = 587) found evidence for benefit of bracing on curve progression compared with controls. A randomized clinical trial and a nonrandomized trial of exercise treatment (N = 184) found favorable reductions in Cobb angle of 0.67° to 4.9° in the intervention group compared with increases of 1.38° to 2.8° in the control group. Two cohort studies (n = 339) on long-term outcomes found that braced participants reported more negative treatment experience and body appearance compared with surgically treated or untreated participants. A study that combined a randomized clinical trial and cohort design (n = 242) reported harms of bracing, which included skin problems on the trunk and nonback body pains. There was no evidence on the effect of AIS screening on adult health outcomes.\nConclusions and relevance: Screening can detect AIS. Bracing and possibly exercise treatment can interrupt or slow progression of curvature in adolescence. However, there is little or no evidence on long-term outcomes for AIS treated in adolescence, the association between curvature at skeletal maturity and adult health outcomes, the harms of AIS screening or treatment, or the effect of AIS screening on adult health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In the past, science has had a conflicting relationship with the philosophy from which it has detached itself due to the scientific method of Galileo Galilei, but anti-scientific atti-tudes and thoughts still persist in every field of knowledge. Occupational Medicine, like other medical disciplines, increasingly needs to have a scientific foundation that guaran-tees evidence and appropriateness for its varied professional activities. Guidance tools for occupational physicians and, in particular, the Guidelines of Scientific Societies repre-sent an indispensable contribution to correct professional practice. In many countries, in addition to the International Society of Reference and International Commission of Occu-pational Health (ICOH), there are National Societies of Occupational Medicine and many of these, such as the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine, regularly publish policy tools and guidelines for the occupational physician. It is not always possible to base the Guidelines in the field of occupational medicine exclusively on consolidated scientific ev-idence but it is still necessary to increase research and publications aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of specific interventions in the preventive, clinical and rehabilitative field of occupational medicine in order to guide occupational physicians to an increasingly appropriate practice. In Italy, a recent law allows the production of Guidelines that partially exempt criminal lia-bility for inexperience through a System of Guidelines produced by accredited Scientific Societies.",

The high burden of physical inactivity is responsible for a high risk of preventable noncommunicable disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death. In this review, we focus on the beneficial effects of routine physical activity (PA) on the cardiovascular system, the different ways we can achieve and measure PA, and the evidence supporting key public health guidance on optimal PA goals for promoting health. While data indicate modest improvements in leisure-time PA in the United States over the past decade, these developments are not equitably distributed across the population with racial and ethnic minorities, women, and older adults continuing to display lower PA rates. The data reviewed here demonstrate the importance of promoting PA for cardiovascular health and highlight the need to address the enormous burden of physical inactivity, especially in those affected by intersecting disparities influencing both general health and leisure-time PA.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to incorporate preventive services into primary care settings have been underutilized. The first component of delivering preventive services in the primary care setting is the health risk assessment followed by establishment of practice guidelines and protocols for preventive services--who is eligible for what service (based on age, sex, and other clinical characteristics) and when. A computerized reminder system can be useful to track past and currently due preventive services for each patient and can also serve as a follow-up system for test results. Well-trained paramedical personnel can perform appropriate patient counseling and education. The goal of counseling and education is to change patient behavior. The first step in this difficult process is once again to ascertain health risks and then to determine the patient's stage of readiness--defined as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The counselor assists in identification of target behavior, advocates and commends behavior change, reinforces health benefits of behavior change, offers resources, strategies, and support, and creates a plan of action and monitoring mechanisms. Improved implementation of preventive services in primary care could have a major impact on the health of the population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Appropriately developed practice guidelines present statements of best practice based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence from published studies on the outcomes of treatments, which include the application of multiple methods for collecting and evaluating evidence for a wide range of clinical interventions and disciplines. However, the guidelines are neither infallible, nor a substitute for clinical judgment. While the guideline development process is a complex phenomenon, conflict of interest in guideline development and inappropriate methodologies must be avoided. It has been alleged that the guidelines by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) prevent injured workers from receiving the majority of medically necessary and appropriate interventional pain management services. An independent critical appraisal of both chapters of the ACOEM guidelines showed startling findings with a conclusion that these guidelines may not be applied in patient care as they scored below 30% in the majority of evaluations utilizing multiple standardized criteria.\nObjective: To reassess the evidence synthesis for the ACOEM guidelines for the low back pain and chronic pain chapters utilizing an expanded methodology, which includes the criteria included in the ACOEM guidelines with the addition of omitted literature and application of appropriate criteria.\nMethods: For reassessment, randomized trials were utilized as it was in the preparation of the guidelines. In this process, quality of evidence was assessed and recommendations were made based on grading recommendations of Guyatt et al. The level of evidence was determined utilizing the quality of evidence criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as the outdated quality of evidence criteria utilized by ACOEM in the guideline preparation. Methodologic quality of each individual article was assessed utilizing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) methodologic assessment criteria for diagnostic interventions and Cochrane methodologic quality assessment criteria for therapeutic interventions.\nResults: The results of reassessment are vastly different from the conclusions derived by the ACOEM guidelines. The differences in strength of rating for the diagnosis of discogenic pain by provocation discography and facet joint pain by diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks is established with strong evidence. Therapeutic cervical and lumbar medial branch blocks and radiofrequency neurolysis, therapeutic thoracic medial branch blocks, cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, caudal epidural steroid injections, lumbar transforaminal epidural injections, percutaneous and endoscopic adhesiolysis, and spinal cord stimulation qualified for moderate to strong evidence. Additional insight is also provided for evidence rating for intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), automated percutaneous disc decompression, and intrathecal implantables.\nConclusion: The reassessment and reevaluation of the low back and chronic pain chapters of the ACOEM guidelines present results that are vastly different from the published and proposed guidelines. Contrary to ACOEM's conclusions of insufficient evidence for most interventional techniques, the results illustrate moderate to strong evidence for most diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Policy points: Both the underuse and overuse of clinical preventive services relative to evidence-based guidelines are a public health concern. Informed consumers are an important foundation of many components of the Affordable Care Act, including coverage mandates for proven clinical preventive services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Across sociodemographic groups, however, knowledge of and positive attitudes toward evidence-based guidelines for preventive care are extremely low. Given the demonstrated low levels of consumers' knowledge of and trust in guidelines, coupled with their strong preference for involvement in preventive care decisions, better education and decision-making support for evidence-based preventive services are greatly needed.\nContext: Both the underuse and overuse of clinical preventive services are a serious public health problem. The goal of our study was to produce population-based national data that could assist in the design of communication strategies to increase knowledge of and positive attitudes toward evidence-based guidelines for clinical preventive services (including the US Preventive Services Task Force, USPSTF) and to reduce uncertainty among patients when guidelines change or are controversial.\nMethods: In late 2013 we implemented an Internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,529 adults via KnowledgePanel, a probability-based survey panel of approximately 60,000 adults, statistically representative of the US noninstitutionalized population. African Americans, Hispanics, and those with less than a high school education were oversampled. We then conducted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the prevalence of and sociodemographic characteristics associated with key knowledge and attitudinal variables.\nFindings: While 36.4% of adults reported knowing that the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover proven preventive services without cost sharing, only 7.7% had heard of the USPSTF. Approximately 1 in 3 (32.6%) reported trusting that a government task force would make fair guidelines for preventive services, and 38.2% believed that the government uses guidelines to ration health care. Most of the respondents endorsed the notion that research/scientific evidence and expert medical opinion are important for the creation of guidelines and that clinicians should follow guidelines based on evidence. But when presented with patient vignettes in which a physician made a guideline-based recommendation against a cancer-screening test, less than 10% believed that this recommendation alone, without further dialogue and/or the patient's own research, was sufficient to make such a decision.\nConclusions: Given these demonstrated low levels of knowledge and mistrust regarding guidelines, coupled with a strong preference for shared decision making, better consumer education and decision supports for evidence-based guidelines for clinical preventive services are greatly needed.",

Despite their well established effectiveness to reduce fracture risk, emerging concerns related to potential adverse effects have led to a substantial decline in the use of bisphosphonates. Although, the pathogenesis of AFF has not yet been elucidated, the bulk of evidence supports that the well known therapeutic benefits of bisphosphonate far outweigh the relatively low risk of AFFs. Recommendations for early identification of patients at risk for AFF using radiographic imaging have been established. Consensus on the management of AFF and osteoporosis in patients with AFF needs to be formulated.\nSummary: AFF is a rare event associated with long-term bisphosphonate therapy, which represents an apparent paradox in the management of osteoporosis. Improved understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms will be helpful in further refining of screening guidelines and standardization of management and treatment strategies.",

Study subjects were 78 house staff rotating on the 6 general medicine services. The intervention was reminders to physicians printed on daily rounds reports about preventive care for which their patients were eligible, and suggested orders for preventive care provided through the physicians' workstations. The preventive care guidelines were derived from the US Preventive Care Task Force recommendations. Compliance with preventive care guidelines and house staff attitudes toward providing preventive care to hospitalized patients were the main outcome measures.\nResults: No significant differences were seen between intervention and control physicians in compliance with preventive care guidelines in the aggregate or when individual preventive care actions individual preventive care actions were analyzed. This was true even though most physicians endorsed providing most kinds of preventive care for hospitalized patients.\nConclusions: Despite past success in increasing preventive care in the outpatient setting, we were unable, using a moderately intensive intervention, to increase the provision of preventive care during hospitalizations. The physicians providing care during the hospitalization were not the patients' primary care physicians, which proved to be an important barrier. More intensive interventions, or more direct linkages between inpatient and outpatient care providers, may be required to overcome this resistance.",

The aim of PHEs is to identify risk factors and early signs of disease, but also to prevent future illness by early intervention. Therefore, each PHE should include counselling, immunisation and physical examination according to the patient's age and gender. However, deciding whether to screen a patient and choosing the most appropriate screening method can be challenging for general practitioners. The U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) provides updated recommendations on different existing preventive care measures based on relevant literature review. The aim of this review is to provide an updated statement of recommendations regarding preventive care measures based mostly on the guidelines derived from the USPSTF and the Swiss Medical Board. Among the major updates, there is no recommendation anymore to routinely screen for breast cancer and prostate cancer in asymptomatic adults. Since 2013, however, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT in patients aged 55 to 80 years with a smoking history of ≥30 pack years. During PHEs, the physician should be alert to the patients' hidden agendas, which are the reason for one third of all consultations in primary care.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increase in maternal deaths from cardiovascular disease in many countries. In high-income countries, cardiovascular deaths secondary to cardiomyopathies, ischemic heart disease, sudden arrhythmic deaths, aortic dissection, and valve disease are responsible for up to one-third of all pregnancy-related maternal deaths. In low- and middle-income countries, rheumatic heart disease is a much more common cause of cardiac death during pregnancy. Although deaths occur in women with known heart conditions or cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, many women present for the first time in pregnancy with unrecognised heart disease or with de novo cardiovascular conditions such as preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Not only has maternal cardiovascular mortality increased, but serious cardiac morbidity, or \"near misses,\" during pregnancy also have increased in frequency. Although maternal morbidity and mortality are often preventable, many health professionals remain unaware of the impact of cardiovascular disease in this population, and the lack of awareness contributes to inappropriate care and preventable deaths. In this review, we discuss the maternal mortality from cardiovascular causes in both high- and low- and middle-income countries and strategies to improve outcomes.",

This study evaluated the extent to which randomized trials are cited in guidelines published in major journals. The references of 191 guidelines of therapeutic and/or preventive interventions published in Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, NEJM and Pediatrics in 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999, were analyzed. The percentage of guidelines not citing any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) decreased gradually from 95% in 1979 to 53% in 1999. Among 4,853 references of the guidelines, there were 393 RCTs (8.1% of total), 19 systematic reviews (0.4%), and 23 meta-analyses of RCTs (0.5%). Among 19 guidelines published in 1999 or 1994 with <2 RCTs cited, in eight cases additional pertinent RCTs were identified that had not been cited by the guideline. There is a clear increase in the use of randomized evidence by guidelines over time. However, several guidelines in major journals still cite few or no RCTs.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Current guidelines for prevention of obesity in childhood and adolescence are discussed.\nMethods: A literature search was performed in Medline via PubMed, and appropriate studies were analyzed.\nResults: Programs to prevent childhood obesity have so far remained mainly school-based and effects have been limited. Analyses by age group show that prevention programs have the best results in younger children (<12 years). Evidence-based recommendations for pre-school- and early school-aged children indicate the need for interventions that address parents and teachers alike. During adolescence, school-based interventions proved most effective when adolescents were addressed directly. To date, obesity prevention programs have mainly focused on behavior-oriented prevention. Recommendations for community- or environment-based prevention have been suggested by the German Alliance of Noncommunicable Diseases and include a minimum of 1 h of physical activity at school, promotion of healthy food choices by taxing unhealthy foods, mandatory standards for meals at kindergartens and schools as well as a ban on unhealthy food advertisement aimed at children.\nConclusion: Behavior-oriented prevention programs showed only limited long-term effects. Certain groups at risk for the development of obesity are not reached effectively by current programs. Although universally valid conclusions cannot be drawn given the heterogeneity of available studies, clearly combining behavior-based programs with community-based prevention to counteract an 'obesogenic environment' is crucial for sustainable success of future obesity prevention programs.",

    "abstract": "Objective: For the first time in its history, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published a recommendation on screening for eating disorders among adolescents and adults in primary care. The current manuscript provides an overview of the USPSTF recommendation, screening principles, and suggestions for clinical and research efforts.\nMethod: The USPSTF based their recommendations on a rigorous systematic review of the evidence on routine screening for eating disorders. Eligible studies included studies of screening test accuracy and controlled trials of screening or interventions for eating disorders in screen-detected or previously untreated eating disorders. The current manuscript briefly summarizes the results of this evidence review which are published in full elsewhere and focuses on providing interpretation of the recommendations by clarifying the scope and methodology of the USPSTF.\nResults: Fifty-seven studies were included in the evidence review. Seventeen studies evaluated screening test accuracy and 40 trials evaluated interventions among populations with previously untreated eating disorders. No studies directly assessed the benefits and harms of screening. The evidence review highlights important gaps in our knowledge regarding eating disorders in primary care. The authors provide recommendations for future studies in light of these evidence gaps and propose specific clinical strategies to improve care for those with eating disorders who present to primary care.\nDiscussion: Primary care can play an important role in the early detection of eating disorders, but data are needed to more fully understand the potential benefits and harms of routine screening in this setting.\nPublic significance: There are gaps in the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of eating disorder screening in primary care. Future studies are needed to improve certainty about the net benefit of screening. Of particular importance are studies that compare routine screening to usual care (no screening). Current providers may benefit from tailored eating disorders education and training, practical tools, and integration of mental health services in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Oral cancer is a major public health problem, and there is an increasing trend for oral cancer to affect young men and women. Public awareness is poor, and many patients present with late-stage disease, contributing to high mortality. Oral cancer is often preceded by a clinical premalignant phase accessible to visual inspection, and thus there are opportunities for earlier detection and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Screening asymptomatic individuals by systematic visual oral examinations to detect the disease has been shown to be feasible. A positive screen includes both oral cancer and oral potentially malignant disorders. We review key screening studies undertaken, including 1 randomized clinical trial. Screening of high-risk groups is cost-effective. Strengths and weaknesses of oral cancer screening studies are presented to help guide new research in primary care settings and invigorated by the prospect of using emerging new technologies that may help to improve discriminatory accuracy of case detection. Most national organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force, have so far not recommended population-based screening due a lack of sufficient evidence that screening leads to a reduction in oral cancer mortality. Where health care resources are high, opportunistic screening in dental practices is recommended, although the paucity of research in primary care is alarming. The results of surveys suggest that dentists do perform oral cancer screenings, but there is only weak evidence that screening in dental practices leads to downstaging of disease. Where health care resources are low, the feasibility of using primary health care workers for oral cancer screening has been tested, and measures indicate good outcomes. Most studies reported in the literature are based on 1 round of screening, whereas screening should be a continuous process. This review identifies a huge potential for new research directions on screening for oral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Primary care provider's (PCP) perceptions of colorectal cancer screening test effectiveness and their recommendations for testing intervals influence patient screening uptake. Few large studies have examined providers' perceptions and recommendations, including their alignment with evidence suggesting comparable test effectiveness and guideline recommendations for screening frequency. Providers (n = 1,281) within four healthcare systems completed a survey in 2017-2018 regarding their perceptions of test effectiveness and recommended intervals for colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for patients ages 40-49, 50-74, and ≥75 years. For patients 50-74 (screening eligible), 82.9% of providers rated colonoscopy as very effective versus 59.6% for FIT, and 26.3% rated colonoscopy as more effective than FIT. Also, for this age group, 77.9% recommended colonoscopy every 10 years and 92.4% recommended FIT annually. For patients ages 40-49 and ≥75, more than one-third of providers believed the tests were somewhat or very effective, although >80% did not routinely recommend screening by either test for these age groups. Provider screening test interval recommendations generally aligned with colorectal cancer guidelines; however, 25% of providers believed colonoscopy was more effective than FIT for mortality reduction, which differs from some modeling studies that suggest comparable effectiveness. The latter finding may have implications for health systems where FIT is the dominant screening strategy. Only one-third of providers reported believing these screening tests were effective in younger and older patients (i.e., <50 and ≥75 years). Evidence addressing these beliefs may be relevant if cancer screening recommendations are modified to include older and/or younger patients.",

Changes in cervical cancer screening and guidelines, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations, and colposcopy standards from the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) have implications for all primary care clinicians, not only those who perform colposcopies. Primary care clinicians should offer HPV vaccination to all patients between the ages of nine and 26, in addition to cervical cancer screening and follow-up guidance. Primary care clinicians should recognize the degrees of risk of high-grade CIN and cancer conferred by cytology, HPV subtype, and persistence of HPV infection. Clinicians should address modifiable risk factors such as tobacco use, and provide counseling to patients about colposcopy based on their individual risks. Clinicians should conduct shared decision-making about immediate loop electrosurgical excision procedure vs. colposcopy with multiple biopsies and endocervical sampling for patients with the highest risk of cervical cancer, and for patients who are older than 25 years with at least two of the following: HPV-16, HPV-18, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology. Primary care clinicians should be familiar with the 2019 ASCCP guidelines and develop clinic-based systems to ensure appropriate follow-up of abnormal cytology, positive high-risk HPV testing, diagnosed CIN, and cervical cancer. Patients with an abnormal cervical cancer screening history require surveillance, which differs from routine screening for patients with normal prior screening results.

    "abstract": "The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that individuals with a cervix initiate cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and undergo primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred); if primary HPV testing is not available, then individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years (acceptable) (strong recommendation). The ACS recommends that individuals aged >65 years who have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years, discontinue all cervical cancer screening (qualified recommendation). These new screening recommendations differ in 4 important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations: 1) The preferred screening strategy is primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable where access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not yet available; 2) the recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years; 3) primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone when primary testing is not available, is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years; and 4) the guideline is transitional, ie, options for screening with cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing for cervical cancer screening is available without barriers. Evidence related to other relevant issues was reviewed, and no changes were made to recommendations for screening intervals, age or criteria for screening cessation, screening based on vaccination status, or screening after hysterectomy. Follow-up for individuals who screen positive for HPV and/or cytology should be in accordance with the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person-years of life lost from cancer among US men and women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced lung cancer mortality. Our objective was to update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2013 lung cancer screening (LCS) guideline for adults at high risk for lung cancer. The guideline is intended to provide guidance for screening to health care providers and their patients who are at high risk for lung cancer due to a history of smoking. The ACS Guideline Development Group (GDG) utilized a systematic review of the LCS literature commissioned for the US Preventive Services Task Force 2021 LCS recommendation update; a second systematic review of lung cancer risk associated with years since quitting smoking (YSQ); literature published since 2021; two Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network-validated lung cancer models to assess the benefits and harms of screening; an epidemiologic and modeling analysis examining the effect of YSQ and aging on lung cancer risk; and an updated analysis of benefit-to-radiation-risk ratios from LCS and follow-up examinations. The GDG also examined disease burden data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms. The GDG judged that the overall evidence was moderate and sufficient to support a strong recommendation for screening individuals who meet the eligibility criteria. LCS in men and women aged 50-80 years is associated with a reduction in lung cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports LCS for men and women older than 80 years who are in good health. The ACS recommends annual LCS with low-dose computed tomography for asymptomatic individuals aged 50-80 years who currently smoke or formerly smoked and have a ≥20 pack-year smoking history (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Before the decision is made to initiate LCS, individuals should engage in a shared decision-making discussion with a qualified health professional. For individuals who formerly smoked, the number of YSQ is not an eligibility criterion to begin or to stop screening. Individuals who currently smoke should receive counseling to quit and be connected to cessation resources. Individuals with comorbid conditions that substantially limit life expectancy should not be screened. These recommendations should be considered by health care providers and adults at high risk for lung cancer in discussions about LCS. If fully implemented, these recommendations have a high likelihood of significantly reducing death and suffering from lung cancer in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cancer screening is chiefly performed by primary care providers (PCPs) who rely on organizational screening guidelines. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations; however, they are often without unanimity leading to divergent screening recommendations.\nObjective: Due to the high incidence of breast cancer, the availability of screening methods, and the presence of multiple incongruent guideline recommendations, we sought to understand breast cancer screening practices in Wisconsin to identify patterns that would allow us to improve evidence-based screening adherence.\nMethods: A 46-question survey on breast cancer screening beliefs and practices for average-risk women was sent to healthcare providers in Wisconsin in 2018, who provided cancer screening services to women. Providers included physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and midwives.\nResults: A total of 295 people responded to the survey, for a response rate of 28.6%. Most respondents were physicians (64.1%), followed by NPs (25.7%), PAs (5.3%), and midwives (1.5%). Of physicians, most practiced family medicine (65.3%), followed by internal medicine (25.3%) and gynecology (9.4%). The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) was reported as being \"very influential\" for 60.5% of providers, followed by the American Cancer Society at 46.8%. For patients 40-49 years old, 75.6% of providers performed clinical breast exams and 58.5% recommended self-breast exams; these numbers increased for women 50+ years old to 78.7% and 61.2%, respectively. Mammography was more likely to be recommended annually for women aged 40-49 rather than biennially by non-physician clinicians compared to physicians (p < .001).\nConclusions: PCPs in Wisconsin continue to overestimate the efficacy of clinical and self-breast exams as well as overuse these in clinical practice. Providers find multiple screening guidelines influential but favor the USPSTF; however, these guidelines are frequently not being followed. Further research needs to be done to investigate the lack of national guideline adherence by providers to improve compliance with evidence-based screening recommendations.",

The aim of this study is to assess the level of familiarity and knowledge PCPs have with breast cancer screening recommendations for TGD patients. An anonymous survey was distributed to primary care physicians, primary care advanced practice practitioners, and internal medicine and family medicine residents at three academic medical systems in the United States (Mayo Clinic, University of Michigan, University of Texas - Medical Branch). Survey questions assessed the familiarity and knowledge base of TGD breast cancer screening recommendations, training and experience with TGD patients, and basic demographics of the practitioners. Of the 95 survey respondents, only 35% of respondents were aware that breast cancer screening recommendations for TGD patients existed. PCPs who had increased transgender specific health care training and direct clinical exposure to TGD patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of screening recommendation awareness. Two-thirds of respondents received TGD specific medical education during training or medical career and those who had increased transgender specific medical education or direct clinical exposure to TGD patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of screening recommendation awareness. Awareness of breast cancer screening recommendations for TGD patients is low among PCPs and varied based on the practitioner's prior TGD education and experience.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has played a critical role in reducing prostate cancer mortality but remains controversial due to concerns regarding overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and inconsistent screening guidelines. In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a grade D recommendation against PSA screening, leading to a national decline in PSA testing and prostate biopsy rates. This was followed by an increase in the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis. The USPSTF has since revised its recommendation to grade C, emphasizing shared decision-making for men aged 55 to 69 years. However, variability in screening recommendations across professional societies has resulted in clinical uncertainty, particularly for primary care physicians (PCPs), who frequently initiate PSA testing and urology referrals. This review provides an evidence-based overview of PSA screening tailored for the PCP. We performed a comprehensive literature review using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, including systematic reviews published between January 2020 and April 2025, and current guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Association of Urology (EAU), and American Cancer Society (ACS). We summarize the evolving landscape of PSA screening and its integration with contemporary tools such as shared decision-making, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and transperineally targeted biopsy. We advocate for initiating PSA screening between the ages of 45 and 49 in men with average or elevated risk, based on long-term evidence demonstrating the value of an early baseline PSA level and risk-stratified follow-up. This approach, coupled with improved diagnostic tools, can help PCPs navigate guideline variability and implement a rational, common-sense strategy to maximize early detection while minimizing harm.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. Less than one-half of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. Ovarian cancer affects women of all ages but is most commonly diagnosed after menopause. More than 75% of affected women are diagnosed at an advanced stage because early-stage disease is usually asymptomatic and symptoms of late-stage disease are nonspecific. The strongest risk factors are advancing age and family history of ovarian and breast cancer. Women who have symptoms concerning for ovarian cancer should undergo a physical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and measurement of biomarkers such as cancer antigen 125. If results are suspicious for ovarian cancer, the patient should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. Despite the low rate of early diagnosis, guidelines recommend against routine screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women because screening, including routine pelvic examinations, is ineffective and associated with harm. However, a recent trial found a potential benefit of annual screening using an algorithm based on serial cancer antigen 125 measurements followed by transvaginal ultrasonography for women at increased risk, as determined by the algorithm. Women with an increased-risk family history should be referred for genetic counseling and, if genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA mutations) are identified, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy can be considered for risk reduction. In both average- and high-risk women, long-term hormonal contraceptive use reduces risk by about 50%. The treatment of ovarian cancer usually involves surgery, with or without intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy. Primary care physicians have important roles in posttreatment surveillance and end-of-life care.",

In 1965, Wilson and Jungner published an influential set of screening principles focused on the health problem's importance, the screening tool's performance, and the evidence for treatment efficacy. However, if we want realistic estimates of the population effects of routine screening, we must also account for the health care system's real-world functioning and disparities in care. We offer revised principles to guide discussions about routine screening in the primary care setting. We add to Wilson and Jungner's principles: 1. A focus on life course epidemiology and its consequences for population health, 2. A need to screen for the early stages of chronic health problems, 3. A concern for screening's acceptability to providers and the community, 4. A recommendation for estimating the uncertainty in benefits and harms in evaluating screening, 5. Inclusion of systematic plans for population data collection and monitoring, and 6. Recognition that achieving population health improvement requires a high-performing system with sufficient throughput and monitoring to deliver accessible, affordable, and effective care, especially for the groups experiencing the greatest inequities in access. Above all, instead of assuming best practices in treatment delivery and monitoring after screening, we argue for realism about the health care system functioning in routine practice.",

For women 40-48 years, mammography use was modestly lower for those cared for by PCPs who believed that screening was ineffective compared with those who believed it was somewhat or very effective (59.1%, 62.3%, and 64.7%; p = 0.019 after controlling for patient characteristics). Of women with PCPs who reported they did not recommend screening before age 50, 48.1% were nonetheless screened. For women age 49-74 years, the vast majority were cared for by providers who believed that screening was effective. Provider recommendations were not associated with screening frequency. For women ≥75 years, those cared for by providers who were uncertain about effectiveness had higher screening use (50.7%) than those cared for by providers who believed it was somewhat effective (42.8%). Patients of providers who did not recommend screening were less likely to be screened than were those whose providers recommended annual screening, yet 37.1% of patients whose providers recommended against screening still received screening.\nConclusions: PCP beliefs about mammography effectiveness and screening recommendations are only modestly associated with use, suggesting other likely influences on patient participation in mammography.",

    "abstract": "Importance: The number of deaths from cervical cancer in the United States has decreased substantially since the implementation of widespread cervical cancer screening and has declined from 2.8 to 2.3 deaths per 100 000 women from 2000 to 2015.\nObjective: To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for cervical cancer.\nEvidence review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for cervical cancer, with a focus on clinical trials and cohort studies that evaluated screening with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone or hrHPV and cytology together (cotesting) compared with cervical cytology alone. The USPSTF also commissioned a decision analysis model to evaluate the age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal interval for screening, the effectiveness of different screening strategies, and related benefits and harms of different screening strategies.\nFindings: Screening with cervical cytology alone, primary hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Screening women aged 21 to 65 years substantially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The harms of screening for cervical cancer in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with both tests (cotesting) in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms. Screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and women younger than 21 years does not provide significant benefit. Screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer provides no benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate to high certainty that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, screening women younger than 21 years, and screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer does not result in a positive net benefit.\nConclusions and recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting) in women aged 30 to 65 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.

    "abstract": "In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed among adults and the second leading cause of death from cancer. For this guideline update, the American Cancer Society (ACS) used an existing systematic evidence review of the CRC screening literature and microsimulation modeling analyses, including a new evaluation of the age to begin screening by race and sex and additional modeling that incorporates changes in US CRC incidence. Screening with any one of multiple options is associated with a significant reduction in CRC incidence through the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps and other precancerous lesions and with a reduction in mortality through incidence reduction and early detection of CRC. Results from modeling analyses identified efficient and model-recommendable strategies that started screening at age 45 years. The ACS Guideline Development Group applied the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria in developing and rating the recommendations. The ACS recommends that adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As a part of the screening process, all positive results on noncolonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that: 1) average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are: fecal immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Given the increase in youth mental health concerns, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends universal suicide screening for ages 12 and older, with positive screens followed by a brief suicide risk assessment. However, it is unclear how pediatric clinicians incorporate this recommendation into practice. Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study was to identify pediatric clinicians' current practice, attitudes, and barriers to implement the updated universal suicide screening recommendation in primary care.\nMethods: Community-based pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) in the St. Louis Metropolitan area who by self-report provide mental health care for patients participated. Participants completed a 30-minute semi-structured interview with invitations extended through an electronic listserv in a local Pediatric PCP Learning Collaborative. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using consensual deductive and inductive approaches until data saturation.\nResults: Eighteen PCPs participated in the interviews. Interviews described themes related to acceptability of the recommendations, PCPs' current screening practices, and perceived barriers for implementing the recommendations. Overall, PCPs agreed with, but expressed hesitancy about, the recommendation. Frequently mentioned barriers to suicide screening included time, training, and inadequate access to resources for follow-up care for at-risk patients. Yet, PCPs were optimistic they could learn with support and were interested in working in this subject area through quality improvement interventions.\nConclusions: PCPs agree with the AAP recommendation about suicide screening but need support to implement into practice. Specifically, PCPs need time sensitive strategies, resources, training, and practice change support to assist these efforts.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Supplemental MRI screening for women at high risk for breast cancer is underutilized. Our study assessed how primary care providers in our healthcare network identify high-risk women and recommend high-risk screening breast MRI.\nMethods: An electronic survey was distributed to providers in OB/GYN, family, and internal medicine departments between 1/14/19 and 3/22/19. The survey inquired about methods used to assess breast cancer risk, familiarity with the American Cancer Society's definition of high-risk, and whether screening breast MRI is recommended for high-risk women.\nResults: Response rate was 17% (89/524). After excluding providers who ordered ≤10 mammograms per year, the study included 75 respondents, who mostly ordered 10-1000 mammograms per year and supported annual/biennial screening mammogram starting at age 40-50 years. More providers reported estimating breast cancer risk qualitatively (with family, clinical history, and/or breast density) than quantitatively with risk calculators (73/75, 97% vs 22/75, 29%). A minority of providers (23/75, 31%) correctly defined high lifetime risk. Only 9/75 (12%) providers recommended screening MRI for high-risk women. Use of quantitative risk calculators or ability to correctly define high-risk were not associated with likelihood of recommending MRI screening. More providers had recommended MRI for screening in the setting of dense breasts than for high-risk screening (23/75, 31% vs 9/75, 12%).\nConclusion: Primary care providers at our institution did not routinely recommend screening MRI for high-risk women. Risk assessment and reporting at the time of mammography may improve MRI utilization and is an opportunity for radiologists to add value and directly participate in patient-centered care.",

    "title": "Recognising Lung Cancer in Primary Care",
    "abstract": "Significant advances in the management of both early and advanced stage lung cancer have not yet led to the scale of improved outcomes which have been achieved in other cancers over the last 40 years. Diagnosis of lung cancer at the earliest stage of disease is strongly associated with improved survival. Therefore, although recent advances in oncology may herald breakthroughs in effective treatment, achieving early diagnosis will remain crucial to obtaining optimal outcomes. This is challenging, as most lung cancer symptoms are non-specific or are common respiratory symptoms which usually represent benign disease. Identification of patients at risk of lung cancer who require further investigation is an important responsibility for general practitioners (GPs). Diagnosis has historically relied upon plain chest X-ray (CXR), organised in response to symptoms. The sensitivity of this modality, however, compares unfavourably with that of computed tomography (CT). In some jurisdictions screening high-risk individuals with low dose CT (LDCT) is now recommended. However uptake remains low and the eligibility for screening programmes is restricted. Therefore, even if screening is widely adopted, most patients will continue to be diagnosed after presenting with symptoms. Achieving early diagnosis requires GPs to maintain an appropriate level of suspicion and readiness to investigate in high-risk patients or those with non-resolving symptoms. This article discusses the early detection of lung cancer from a primary care perspective. We outline risk factors and epidemiology, the role of screening and offer guidance on the recognition of symptomatic presentation and the investigation and referral of suspected lung cancer.",

    "title": "Primary Human Papillomavirus Screening: Women's Perceptions of New Cervical Cancer Screening Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Background: Current clinical guidelines recommended primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening for cervical cancer testing. Previous studies reported patient-level barriers (e.g., limited knowledge and attachment to Pap test) that may hinder wide adoption of primary HPV screening. We assessed these women-level factors following the implementation of primary HPV screening (July 2020) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). Methods: We administered a patient survey (mail and on-line) to female KPSC members aged 30-65 years who received primary HPV screening between October and December 2020. Those who preferred English vs. Spanish language were sampled separately. The survey included domains on knowledge about HPV and HPV screening, awareness of screening guidelines, and attitudes about HPV testing. Demographic data were collected using electronic health records. We used weighted multivariable logistic and modified Poisson regressions for associations between language preference and survey responses. Results: In total, 3,009 surveys were returned (38.0% response rate). Few women (7.0%) found HPV testing as an acceptable screening method. The majority of women (92.2%) remained unaware that HPV testing can replace Pap test for screening. The Pap test was the most preferred screening approach for 33.2% Spanish-speaking women vs. 19.9% English-speaking women. Only 20.6% knew that women aged 30-65 years can be screened every 5 years with cotest or primary HPV screening. Most women (96.4%) did not perceive stigma about taking the HPV test. Conclusion: Proactive patient education will help improve women's knowledge about primary HPV screening, which may facilitate its implementation in additional health care settings.",

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires shared decision-making (SDM) for lung cancer screening reimbursement. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an SDM intervention on lung cancer screening in primary care.\nMethods: The study design was a single-arm clinical trial design. The intervention included phone contact outside of a primary care visit and the use of the Decision Counseling Program ®, an online interactive decision aid focused on determining the factors which influence patients to screen or not screen, prioritizing those factors, and determining a decision preference score. The primary outcome was the completion of low-dose computed tomography scan (LDCT) 1 year after the SDM session compared in participants versus nonparticipants.\nResults: From six practices, there were 1359 potentially eligible patients in electronic medical record data, and 336 were reached to assess eligibility criteria. A total of 80 patients consented to be in the study, 64 completed a decision counseling session and 16 did not complete a session. Among the 64 people who agreed to have decision counseling, 45% had LDCT, higher than typically seen in routine clinical practice. Although not a comparable group, among the 16 people who declined decision counseling, none had LDCT.\nConclusions: Decision counseling is a promising intervention that might support SDM in the context of improving uptake of lung cancer screening in primary care. However, further, larger studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Historical prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening studies reduced prostate cancer-related deaths but also led to overdiagnosis/overtreatment. Since then, opportunistic PSA testing has increased, and late-stage diagnoses and prostate-cancer related deaths are rising.\nObjectives: To review current trends regarding PSA testing in primary care and propose a collaborative approach to improve early prostate cancer detection.\nDiscussion: Opportunistic PSA testing patterns vary among General Practitioners (GPs) and Family Doctors (FDs) based on differing guidelines, patient pressure, time constraints and personal views/preferences. However, an organised, risk-adapted strategy, as outlined by the European Association of Urology's guidelines, could facilitate the early diagnosis of significant prostate cancer whilst sparing those unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms from further tests (overdiagnosis) as well as the psychosocial consequences of a cancer diagnosis. This could be achieved by the introduction of national prostate cancer screening programmes, which has been endorsed in the European Commission's publication of the EU Cancer Screening Recommendations. In this scenario, GPs/FDs would still play an important role in supporting men throughout the decision pathway. However, as some men may still request a PSA test from their GP/FD, patient information as well as clear guidance and support to GPs/FDs are needed, including appropriate skills training to facilitate effective counselling and informed decision-making, and the use of risk calculators to inform referral decisions.\nConclusion: GPs/FDs play an important role in counselling healthy men eligible to consider PSA testing. However, clear guidance, training and support is required for them to assume this role.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends systematic developmental screening at all 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well-child visits (WCVs) and autism-specific screening at all 18- and 24-month WCVs. The study objectives were to examine the extent to which these guidelines have been adopted in practice among primary care providers (PCPs) and to identify potential provider-level factors associated with screening practices.\nMethod: Participants included 94 PCPs (79% pediatricians) from 13 states enrolled in a study of an autism training program. Self-report and chart-review data collected before training were examined. Screening practices were assessed through chart review of all 9-, 18-, and 24-month WCVs within a 30-day window.\nResults: Sixty-four percent of PCPs administered developmental screening tools at all 9-month WCVs, and 62% at all 18-month WCVs. Fifty-one percent administered autism screening tools at all 18-month WCVs, and 41% at all 24-month WCVs. Screening practices varied by provider type (pediatrician vs other PCP), self-efficacy in screening and identification, and previous autism training (autism screening only), but not by years of experience.\nConclusion: Overall, general developmental and autism-specific screenings are not being consistently administered across recommended WCVs in primary care practices. Provider self-efficacy in autism identification and screening and previous autism training were associated with increased autism screening. As such, these results suggest a need for increased training and dissemination of information on screening implementation for practicing PCPs.",

    "title": "Barriers and recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in Africa",
    "abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The incidence of CRC is rising in low- and middle-income countries but decreasing in high-income countries due to the widespread use of surveillance colonoscopy. In Africa, the implementation of screening programs remains a challenge, even in countries, such as Ghana that have established CRC screening guidelines.\nObjective: The purpose of this review was to identify the barriers and recommend strategies for implementing CRC screening in African countries.\nMethods: A literature search using PubMed was conducted with the following search terms: colorectal neoplasm, early detection of cancer, mass screening, colonoscopy, faecal occult blood test, faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and Africa. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 13 articles were reviewed.\nResults: The most common barriers reported were limited endoscopic capacity, poor knowledge of CRC and CRC screening, health care factors, cultural factors and sociodemographic factors. Recommendations to increase the availability of CRC screening tests were to include the use of FITs, to provide more training for health care providers, and to expand educational programs for patients, physicians, and religious/community leaders.\nConclusion: The primary barrier to screening for CRC in Africa is the limited endoscopic capacity, specifically the lack of infrastructure and trained personnel, which requires systematic changes by governing bodies. In addition, health care professionals should be involved in educating patients about CRC and CRC screening. Further research is needed to clarify the factors related to subtypes of CRC and to explore the feasibility of using FITs in Africa.",

Concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment combined with misinterpretation of clinical trial data led to a recommendation against PCa screening, resulting in a subsequent reversion to more high-risk disease at diagnosis. Re-evaluation of trial data and increasing acceptance of active surveillance led to a new draft recommendation for shared decision making for men aged 55 to 69 years old. Further consideration is needed for more intensive screening in men with high-risk factors. PCa screening significantly reduces PCa morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Background: U.S. professional organizations have provided conflicting recommendations on annual vs. biennial mammography screening. Potential harms of more frequent screening include increased anxiety and costs of false positive results, including unnecessary breast biopsies and overdiagnosis.\nObjective: To characterize current practices and beliefs surrounding mammography screening frequency and perspectives on using risk-based screening to inform screening intervals.\nDesign: Semi-structured interviews informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).\nParticipants: Patients, primary care providers (PCPs), third-party stakeholders (breast radiologists, radiology administrators, patient advocates).\nMain measures: Qualitative data, with a codebook developed based upon prespecified implementation science constructs.\nKey results: We interviewed 25 patients, 11 PCPs, and eight key stakeholders, including three radiologists, two radiology administrators, and three patient advocates. Most patients reported having annual mammograms, however, half believed having mammograms every two years was acceptable. Some women were worried early breast cancer would be missed if undergoing biennial screening. PCPs were equally split between recommending annual and biennial mammograms. Although PCPs were interested in using breast cancer risk models to inform screening decisions, concerns raised include time burden and lack of familiarity with breast cancer risk assessment tools. All breast radiologists believed patients should receive annual mammograms, while patient advocates and radiology administrators were split between annual vs. biennial. Radiologists were worried about missing breast cancer diagnoses when mammograms are not performed yearly. Patient advocates and radiology administrators were more open to biennial mammograms and utilizing risk-based screening.\nConclusions: Uncertainty remains across stakeholder groups regarding appropriate mammogram screening intervals. Radiologists recommend annual mammography, whereas patients and PCPs were evenly split between annual vs. biennial screening, although both favored annual screening among higher-risk women. Breast cancer risk assessment tools may help facilitate decisions about screening intervals, but face barriers to widespread implementation in the primary care setting. These results will inform future implementation strategies to adopt risk-stratified breast cancer screening.",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has little benefit among patients with limited life expectancy.\nObjective: To characterize the extent to which PCPs modify their recommendations for CRC screening based upon patients' increasing age and/or worsening comorbidity\nDesign: Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey.\nParticipants: The study comprised primary care physicians (n = 1,266) including general internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics-gynecology physicians.\nMain measures: Physician CRC screening recommendations among patients of varying age and comorbidity were measured based upon clinical vignettes. Independent variables in adjusted models included physician and practice characteristics.\nKey results: For an 80-year-old patient with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 25 % of PCPs recommended CRC screening. For an 80-year-old patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association, Class II), 71 % of PCPs recommended CRC screening. PCPs were more likely to recommend fecal occult blood testing than colonoscopy as the preferred screening modality for a healthy 80-year-old, compared to healthy 50- or 65-year-old patients (19 % vs. 5 % vs. 2 % p < 0.001). For an 80-year-old with unresectable NSCLC, PCPs who were an obstetrics-gynecology physician were more likely to recommend CRC screening, while those with a full electronic medical record were less likely to recommend screening.\nConclusions: PCPs consider comorbidity when screening older patients for CRC and may change the screening modality from colonoscopy to FOBT. However, a sizable proportion of PCPs would recommend screening for patients with advanced cancer who would not benefit. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these patterns will facilitate the design of future medical education and policy interventions to reduce unnecessary care.",

    "abstract": "Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a largely undetected occurrence in the United States reported by 36-50% of women in their lifetime and associated with extensive physical and psychological implications. Currently, conflicting recommendations exist regarding screening practices with the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) advocating for and against universal screening, respectively. With research suggesting that women are seldom asked about IPV during clinic visits, further information is needed regarding current screening practices.\nObjectives: To identify current IPV screening approaches in the primary care setting and factors that may impact screening completion.\nMethods: We retrospectively examined patients presenting for annual examinations at four university-associated primary care clinics in southeast Florida (n = 400). Patient demographics, screener demographics, screening completion, and screening results were collected from the medical record. Results were compared to depression and anxiety screenings due to comparable prevalence and screening recommendations. Pearson chi square and Fisher exact tests were utilized to compare screening rates by demographic characteristics.\nResults: IPV screening occurred at a much lower frequency (8.5%) compared to screenings for anxiety (37.3%) and depression (71.3%). Among documented IPV screenings, 64.7% of encounters resulted in patient refusal to be screened. Screening rates were found to be marginally impacted by patient ethnicity (P = 0.052).\nConclusions: Findings of both low screening rates and low screening success raise significant concerns for the shortcomings of advocating for universal IPV screening. Therefore, additional studies are necessary to identify covert barriers to screening completion before universal inquiry is advised.",

The available data indicate that PCPs are not adequately following CRC screening guidelines because a number of factors have been identified as significant barriers to the proper application of CRC screening guidelines. These factors include lack of time, patient reluctance, and challenges related to scheduling colonoscopy. Further positive engagement of PCPs with CRC screening is required to overcome these barriers and reach acceptable levels in screening rates. To meet the expectations of modern medicine, PCPs should not only be able to recommend occult blood testing or colonoscopy but also, under certain conditions, able to perform colonoscopy.

This review examined possible explanations related to the process of screening, focusing on how parents and youth are engaged, and how providers evaluate and use screening results.\nMethod: A narrative synthesis was developed after a systematic review of 3 databases (plus follow-up of citations, expert recommendations, and checks for multiple publications about the same study). Searching identified 1,188 titles, and of these, 186 full-text articles were reviewed. Two authors extracted data from 45 articles meeting inclusion criteria.\nResults: Published studies report few details about how mental health screens were administered, including how clinicians explain their purpose or confidentiality, or whether help was provided for language, literacy, or disability problems. Although they were not addressed directly in the studies reviewed, uptake and detection rates appeared to vary with means of administration. Screening framed as universal, confidential, and intended to optimize attention to patient concerns increased acceptability. Studies said little about how providers were taught to explore screen results. Screening increased referrals, but many still followed negative screens, in some cases because of parent concerns apparently not reflected by screen results but possibly stemming from screen-prompted discussions.\nConclusions: Little research has addressed the process of engaging patients in mental health screening in pediatric primary care or how clinicians can best use screening results. The literature does offer suggestions for better clinical practice and research that may lead to improvements in uptake and outcome.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To review new evidence reported since the 2016 publication of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommendations and to summarize key facets of lung cancer screening to better equip primary care providers (PCPs) in anticipation of wider implementation of the recommendations.\nQuality of evidence: A new, large randomized controlled trial has been published since 2016, as have updates from 4 other trials. PubMed was searched for studies published between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2020, using search words including lung cancer screening eligibility, lung cancer screening criteria, and lung cancer screening guidelines. All information from peer-reviewed articles, reference lists, books, and websites was considered.\nMain message: Lung cancers diagnosed at stage 4 have a 5-year survival rate of only 5% and have a disproportionate impact on those with lower socioeconomic status, rural populations, and Indigenous populations. By downstaging, or diagnosing lung cancers at an earlier and more treatable stage, lung cancer screening reduces mortality with a number needed to screen of 250 to prevent 1 death. Practical aspects of lung cancer screening are reviewed, including criteria to screen, appropriate low-dose computed tomography screening, and management of findings. Harms of screening, such as overdiagnosis and incidental findings, are discussed to allow PCPs to appropriately counsel their patients in the face of ongoing implementation of new lung cancer screening programs.\nConclusion: Lung cancer screening, with its embedded emphasis on smoking cessation, is an excellent addition to PCPs' preventive health care tools. The implementation of formal and pilot lung cancer screening programs across Canada means that PCPs will be increasingly required to counsel their patients around the uptake of lung cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that women at moderate or high risk of breast cancer be offered risk-reducing medication and enhanced breast screening/surveillance. In June 2022, NICE withdrew a statement recommending assessment of risk in primary care only when women present with concerns. This shift to the proactive assessment of risk substantially changes the role of primary care, in effect paving the way for a primary care-based screening programme to identify those at moderate or high risk of breast cancer. In this article, we review the literature surrounding proactive breast cancer risk assessment within primary care against the consolidated framework for screening. We find that risk assessment for women under 50 years currently satisfies many of the standard principles for screening. Most notably, there are large numbers of women at moderate or high risk currently unidentified, risk models exist that can identify those women with reasonable accuracy, and management options offer the opportunity to reduce breast cancer incidence and mortality in that group. However, there remain a number of uncertainties and research gaps, particularly around the programme/system requirements, that need to be addressed before these benefits can be realised.",

Primary care patients aged 45 to 49 years at average risk for colorectal cancer were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 4 outreach strategies. The trial ran May 2, 2022, to May 13, 2022, with follow-up through November 13, 2022.\nInterventions: Colorectal cancer screening via 1 of 4 strategies: (1) fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-only active choice; (2) colonoscopy-only active choice; (3) dual-modality (FIT or colonoscopy) active choice; and (4) usual care default mailed FIT outreach.\nMain outcome and measures: Primary outcome was participation in screening (FIT or colonoscopy) at 6 months. Secondary outcome was screening modality completed.\nResults: Among 20 509 participants (53.9% female, 4.2% Black and 50.8% non-Hispanic White; mean [SD] age, 47.4 [1.5] years), 3816 (18.6%) underwent screening.

Among 5125 participants offered a choice between 2 modalities (dual-modality active choice FIT or colonoscopy), colonoscopy was more common than FIT (616 [12.0%] vs 288 [5.6%]; rate difference, -6.4%; 95% CI, -7.5% to -5.3%; P < .001). There was notable crossover in the FIT-only groups to colonoscopy (502 of 5131 [9.8%; FIT-only active choice] and 501 of 5126 [9.8%; usual care default mailed FIT]).

This study investigates whether Family Medicine Groups increased rates of guideline-recommended screenings for 3 chronic diseases: colorectal cancer (colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), and osteoporosis (bone mineral density testing).\nMethods: Using population-based administrative health data from the provincial insurer (2000-2010), the authors examined elderly and chronically ill patients who registered with a general practitioner in the first 15 months of the Family Medicine Group policy. Propensity score weighting and a difference-in-differences model estimated differential change in biennial screening rates among Family Medicine Group and non-Family Medicine Group patients over 5 years of follow-up (analysis, 2016-2018).\nResults: Rates of mammography, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, and bone mineral density testing increased after patient registration with a general practitioner, similarly for both Family Medicine Group and non-Family Medicine Group patients. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy rates increased by 9.7% and 10.4% for Family Medicine Group and non-Family Medicine Group patients, mammography rates by 5.3% and 3.4%, and bone mineral density testing by 4.2% and 7.1%. Difference-in-differences estimates showed no detectable effect of Family Medicine Groups on disease screening rates: -0.06 percentage points (95% CI= -0.32, 0.20) for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, 1.01 percentage points (95% CI= -0.25, 2.27) for mammography, and -0.32 (95% CI= -0.71, -0.07) for bone mineral density testing.\nConclusions: This study found no evidence that Family Medicine Groups affected screening rates for these 3 chronic diseases. Limitations in the implementation of the Family Medicine Group policy in its early years may have contributed to this lack of impact. Interprofessional primary care teams may need to include elements other than organizational changes to increase disease prevention efforts.",

A policy to screen primary care patients for depression has appeal as a strategy to reduce the personal and societal costs of undiagnosed and untreated depression. Such appeal may be justified if the evidence supports the screening policy in three areas: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility. The USPSTF recommendation leaves many issues in each of these areas unresolved and physicians are left the choice of two important program characteristics: screening instrument and screening interval. We discuss how uncertainties in the screening protocol and treatment process affect whether screening is an effective and cost-effective use of resources with respect to other health interventions. We suggest that targeting screening to groups at a higher risk for depression may lead to a more effective use of health care resources. A screening program may not be feasible even if effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are optimized. We discuss uncertainties in the USPSTF recommendation that affect the feasibility of implementing such a program in physicians' practices.",

    "abstract": "Background: In 2012, new cervical cancer screening guidelines were published by three widely recognized entities which advocate delayed onset of testing, fewer screenings, selective use of human papilloma virus co-testing, and no further screening in women over age 65 years. Early observations report that these recommendations are not being followed and overscreening is common. This study seeks to understand why primary care providers might not adhere to these new 'best practice' health policy protocols.\nMethods: A total of 4,909 randomly selected primary care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) practicing in California were mailed a study questionnaire. Participants were asked if they consider current published screening guidelines to be authoritative, reliable, and/or clinically appropriate. Clinical vignettes captured individual provider beliefs on timing and method of cervical cancer screening in women within the four key age groups embedded in current screening guidelines.\nResults: Of the 4,909 surveys mailed, 1,268 (25.8%) qualified responses were received. Fundamentally, 35.0% of all primary care providers do not believe current guidelines are clinically appropriate, with 58.6% of obstetrician/gynecologist physicians having this same skepticism. Even among those who affirmatively believe current guidelines are authoritative, reliable, and clinically appropriate, only 15.3% recommend screening intervals and methodology of testing in women of four differing ages consistent with that of current policy guidelines.\nConclusion: Among the primary care providers surveyed, distrust and confusion likely limit adherence to current evidence-based cervical cancer screening health policy recommendations, and contribute to the current high rates of overscreening that have been observed.",

The CTFPHC recently updated this guideline and recommended against routinely screening adults for depression in primary care because there have not been any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have shown depression screening to be beneficial and because of a concern about the potentially high number of false-positive screens that would occur. Without evidence from RCTs of better health outcomes from screening, there are numerous factors that suggest that depression screening, even with collaborative depression care, may not be beneficial for patients, including the high rate of patients already treated, uncertainty about the ability of depression screening tools to accurately identify previously unrecognized patients, and relatively small treatment effects among patients with less severe depression who would be most likely to be identified through screening. Routine screening would expose some patients to avoidable risks and would pose a significant cost burden.\nConclusion: The CTFPHC recommendation to not screen for depression in primary care is consistent with available evidence. Clinicians in primary care settings should be alert to signs of depression and attend to symptoms through assessment and, as appropriate, referral or management, as recommended by the CTFPHC.",

    "abstract": "Prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a great challenge worldwide. The aim of this evidence synthesis was to summarize the available evidence in order to update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy. We conducted a systematic review and, where appropriate, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) carried out in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (six studies) or dysmetabolism (one study) to answer the following questions: What is the evidence that T2D is preventable by lifestyle changes? What is the optimal diet (with a particular focus on diet quality) for prevention, and does the prevention of T2D result in a lower risk of late complications of T2D? The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the certainty of the trial evidence. Altogether seven RCTs (N = 4090) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnosis of incident diabetes was based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The overall risk reduction of T2D by the lifestyle interventions was 0.53 (95% CI 0.41; 0.67). Most of the trials aimed to reduce weight, increase physical activity, and apply a diet relatively low in saturated fat and high in fiber. The PREDIMED trial that did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis was used in the final assessment of diet quality. We conclude that T2D is preventable by changing lifestyle and the risk reduction is sustained for many years after the active intervention (high certainty of evidence). Healthy dietary changes based on the current recommendations and the Mediterranean dietary pattern can be recommended for the long-term prevention of diabetes. There is limited or insufficient data to show that prevention of T2D by lifestyle changes results in a lower risk of cardiovascular and microvascular complications.",

    "abstract": "Background: Environmental and lifestyle changes, in addition to the ageing of populations, are generally believed to account for the rapid global increase in type 2 diabetes prevalence and incidence in recent decades.\nDiscussion: In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of factors contributing to diabetes risk, including aspects of diet quality and quantity, little physical activity, increased monitor viewing time or sitting in general, exposure to noise or fine dust, short or disturbed sleep, smoking, stress and depression, and a low socioeconomic status. In general, these factors promote an increase in body mass index. Since loss of β-cell function is the ultimate cause of developing overt type 2 diabetes, environmental and lifestyle changes must have resulted in a higher risk of β-cell damage in those at genetic risk. Multiple mechanistic pathways may come into play.\nConclusions: Strategies of diabetes prevention should aim at promoting a 'diabetes-protective lifestyle' whilst simultaneously enhancing the resistance of the human organism to pro-diabetic environmental and lifestyle factors. More research on diabetes-protective mechanisms seems warranted.",

About 1 in 11 adults worldwide now have diabetes mellitus, 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Asia is a major area of the rapidly emerging T2DM global epidemic, with China and India the top two epicentres. Although genetic predisposition partly determines individual susceptibility to T2DM, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle are important drivers of the current global epidemic; early developmental factors (such as intrauterine exposures) also have a role in susceptibility to T2DM later in life. Many cases of T2DM could be prevented with lifestyle changes, including maintaining a healthy body weight, consuming a healthy diet, staying physically active, not smoking and drinking alcohol in moderation. Most patients with T2DM have at least one complication, and cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This Review provides an updated view of the global epidemiology of T2DM, as well as dietary, lifestyle and other risk factors for T2DM and its complications.",

    "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known.\nMethods: We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years.\nResults: The mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle.\nConclusions: Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.",

Whether diabetes-prevention strategies also ultimately prevent the development of diabetic vascular complications is unknown, but cardiovascular risk factors are favorably affected. Preventive strategies that can be implemented in routine clinical settings have been developed and evaluated. Widespread application has, however, been limited by local financial considerations, even though cost-effectiveness might be achieved at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although the body of evidence indicates clear benefits of dietary modifications for prevention of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it may be difficult for healthcare providers to recommend which diet interventions or dietary factors are appropriate for patients as there are too many modalities available. Accordingly, we performed an umbrella review to synthesize evidence on diet interventions and dietary factors in prevention of T2DM.\nMethods: Medline and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized-controlled trial or observational studies were eligible if they measured effects of diet interventions and/or dietary factors including dietary patterns, food groups, and nutrients on risk of T2DM. The effect of each diet intervention/factor was summarized qualitatively.\nResults: Sixty systematic reviews and meta-analyses were eligible. Results of the review suggest that healthy dietary patterns such as Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets, and high consumption of whole grains, low-fat dairy products, yogurt, olive oil, chocolate, fiber, magnesium, and flavonoid significantly reduced the risk of T2DM. In contrast, high glycemic index and glycemic load diets, high consumption of red and processed meat, and sugar or artificial sugar-sweetened beverages significantly increased risk of T2DM. Prescribing diet interventions with or without physical activity interventions significantly decreased risk of T2DM in both high-risk and general population.\nConclusion: High consumption of Mediterranean and DASH diet, and interventions that modified the quality of diet intake significantly reduced risk of T2DM especially in the high-risk population. These lifestyle modifications should be promoted in both individual and population levels to prevent and decrease burden from T2DM in the future.",

This work aimed to examine the association between a comprehensive Mediterranean-type lifestyle and type 2 diabetes incidence in a British adult population.\nMethods: We used data from 112,493 individuals free of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 40-69 years, from the UK Biobank cohort, who were followed from 2009 to 2010 to 2021. The Mediterranean lifestyle was assessed through the 25-item MEDLIFE index, which comprises three blocks: (a) \"Mediterranean food consumption\", (b) \"Mediterranean dietary habits\", (c) \"Physical activity, rest, social habits, and conviviality\". Diabetes incidence was obtained from clinical records. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to analyze associations and adjusted for the main potential confounders.\nResults: After a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 2,724 cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained. Compared to the first quartile of MEDLIFE adherence, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for increasing quartiles of adherence were 0.90 (0.82-0.99), 0.80 (0.72-0.89) and 0.70 (0.62-0.79) (p-trend < 0.001). All three blocks of MEDLIFE were independently associated with lower risk of diabetes.\nConclusions: Higher adherence to the MEDLIFE index was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank.

    "abstract": "With the advances in diabetes care, the trend of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been decreasing over past decades. However, given that CVD is still a major cause of death in patients with diabetes and that the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM is more than twice that in those without DM, there are still considerable challenges to the prevention of CVD in diabetes. Accordingly, there have been several research efforts to decrease cardiovascular (CV) risk in T2DM. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and clinical cohort studies have investigated the effects of factors, such as genetic determinants, hypoglycaemia, and insulin resistance, on CVD and can account for the unexplained CV risk in T2DM. Lifestyle modification is a widely accepted cornerstone method to prevent CVD as the first-line strategy in T2DM. Recent reports from large CV outcome trials have proven the positive CV effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in patients with high CVD risk. Overall, current practice guidelines for the management of CVD in T2DM are moving from a glucocentric strategy to a more individualised patient-centred approach. This review will discuss the current epidemiologic trends of CVD in T2DM and the risk factors linking T2DM to CVD, including genetic contribution, hypoglycaemia, and insulin resistance, and proper care strategies, including lifestyle and therapeutic approaches.",

Information about their diet and lifestyle was updated periodically. A low-risk group was defined according to a combination of five variables: a bodymass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of less than 25; a diet high in cereal fiber and polyunsaturated fat and low in trans fat and glycemic load (which reflects the effect of diet on the blood glucose level); engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for at least half an hour per day; no current smoking; and the consumption of an average of at least half a drink of an alcoholic beverage per day.\nResults: During 16 years of follow-up, we documented 3300 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Overweight or obesity was the single most important predictor of diabetes. Lack of exercise, a poor diet, current smoking, and abstinence from alcohol use were all associated with a significantly increased risk of diabetes, even after adjustment for the body-mass index. As compared with the rest of the cohort, women in the low-risk group (3.4 percent of the women) had a relative risk of diabetes of 0.09 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.17). A total of 91 percent of the cases of diabetes in this cohort (95 percent confidence interval, 83 to 95) could be attributed to habits and forms of behavior that did not conform to the low-risk pattern.\nConclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that the vast majority of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented by the adoption of a healthier lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Functional foods contain biologically active ingredients associated with physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A regular consumption of functional foods may be associated with enhanced anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitivity, and anti-cholesterol functions, which are considered integral to prevent and manage T2DM. Components of the Mediterranean diet (MD)-such as fruits, vegetables, oily fish, olive oil, and tree nuts-serve as a model for functional foods based on their natural contents of nutraceuticals, including polyphenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, and unsaturated fatty acids. Polyphenols within MD and polyphenol-rich herbs-such as coffee, green tea, black tea, and yerba maté-have shown clinically-meaningful benefits on metabolic and microvascular activities, cholesterol and fasting glucose lowering, and anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation in high-risk and T2DM patients. However, combining exercise with functional food consumption can trigger and augment several metabolic and cardiovascular protective benefits, but it is under-investigated in people with T2DM and bariatric surgery patients. Detecting functional food benefits can now rely on an \"omics\" biological profiling of individuals' molecular, genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, but is under-investigated in multi-component interventions. A personalized approach for preventing and managing T2DM should consider biological and behavioral models, and embed nutrition education as part of lifestyle diabetes prevention studies. Functional foods may provide additional benefits in such an approach.",

In the United States, diabetes is the most common cause of blindness among working-age adults, the most common cause of nontraumatic amputations and end-stage renal disease, and the sixth most common cause of death. For the cohort of Americans born in 2000, the estimated lifetime risk for diabetes is more than 1 in 3. In the next 50 years, the number of diagnosed cases of diabetes is predicted to increase by 165% in the United States, with the largest relative increases seen among African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic/Latino persons. Compelling scientific evidence indicates that lifestyle change prevents or delays the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in high-risk groups. This body of evidence from randomized, controlled trials conducted in 3 countries has definitively established that maintenance of modest weight loss through diet and physical activity reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes in high-risk persons by about 40% to 60% over 3 to 4 years. The number of persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes is similar to the number of persons who have diabetes.

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of culturally bespoke lifestyle programmes in South Asians that target weight loss for the prevention or remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMethods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention trials. PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL were searched. Human intervention trials (randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental) investigating the effect of lifestyle interventions on the prevention and remission of T2DM in South Asians were included. Studies including participants at risk of T2DM (prevention trials) and having the disease (remission trials) with duration ≥12 weeks were eligible. For prevention trials, the primary outcome was change in weight (kg) from baseline; for remission trials, it was decrease in HbA1c to non-diabetic levels (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) without diabetes medications. Prevention trials were separated into (i) lifestyle modification advice and (ii) lifestyle modification advice including a supervised physical activity programme.\nResults: Twenty-four trials were eligible (21 prevention trials and 3 remission trials). In T2DM prevention trials involving only lifestyle modification advice, the mean postintervention difference in weight between intervention and control groups was -0.65 kg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.26; p = 0.01). Lifestyle modification advice including a physical activity programme was associated with greater decreases in weight: -1.13 kg (95% CI: -2.04, -0.21; p = 0.02). Fasting blood glucose levels were slightly lower in intervention groups for both intervention subtypes, although there was no significant change in HbA1c levels or 2-h plasma glucose levels. Diabetes remission trials showed potential acceptability but were limited in number and involved a small sample size, and some did not include a control group.\nConclusions: In South Asians, lifestyle interventions for prevention of T2DM offer only modest impacts on weight and glucose control and will unlikely reduce diabetes incidence. Alternative lifestyle interventions co-designed with members of the communities and aimed at both prevention and remission of T2DM must be urgently considered.

Implementation research assessing the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of delivering these proven programs at the community level has shown success, but more research is needed to overcome barriers to implementation in different settings globally. New avenues of research should be considered to combat this public health issue.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is an epidemic of our time. This disease affects nearly 150 million adults worldwide and nearly 11 million in the United States in 2000. Because of the prevalence of obesity and diabetes and associated vascular complications, preventing even a small proportion of cases would save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost productivity. Researchers have made great strides in identifying many lifestyle and dietary factors associated with diabetes, but solidifying the scientific basis for prevention and control of this disease as well as implementation at a national level remains a difficult challenge. The literature on the influence of diet and lifestyle in the development of diabetes is reviewed here, with emphasis on epidemiologic data. We outline a systematic approach to primary and secondary prevention of this disease by evaluating and prioritizing risk factors for which intervention is effective and developing a framework for application of intervention strategies. Effective interventions must target not only the affected individuals but also families, workplaces, schools and communities. Prevention of this devastating disease calls for the identification of culture-sensitive measures that can be applied to the population in general and some high-risk minority groups in particular.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effects of lifestyle interventions on the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and reversion to normoglycemia by prediabetes phenotype.\nMethods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of lifestyle interventions in adults with prediabetes for a minimum duration of one year. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and performed quality assessment. The relative effects were analyzed using a random-effects model, subgroup analysis was employed to explore the potential effects among subpopulations.\nResults: A total of 31 RCTs involving 23684 participants were analyzed. Compared with usual care, lifestyle interventions reduced the incident T2D by 41 % (RR 0.59 [95 % CI 0.52-0.68]) and increased the probability of reverting to normoglycemia by 44 % (RR 1.44 [95 % CI 1.15-1.81]) in adults with prediabetes. No significant difference was observed between the impaired fasting glucose (IFG5.6)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and IFG6.1/IGT (P = 0.752). IGT + IFG benefited more than isolated IGT in prevention of T2D (RRIGT + IFG 0.47 [95 % CI 0.41-0.55]; RRisolatedIGT 0.77 [95 % CI 0.64-0.93]), whereas no benefit was found in isolated IFG (RR 0.77 [95 % CI 0.51-1.16]) or elevated HbA1c (RR 0.89 [95 % CI 0.74-1.07]).\nConclusions: Lifestyle intervention could help prevent T2D and revert to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes, with significant benefit in people with IGT but not in those with isolated IFG or elevated HbA1c.",

    "abstract": "As years progress, we are found more often in a postprandial than a postabsorptive state. Chrononutrition is an integral part of metabolism, pancreatic function, and hormone secretion. Eating most calories and carbohydrates at lunch time and early afternoon, avoiding late evening dinner, and keeping consistent number of daily meals and relative times of eating occasions seem to play a pivotal role for postprandial glycemia and insulin sensitivity. Sequence of meals and nutrients also play a significant role, as foods of low density such as vegetables, salads, or soups consumed first, followed by protein and then by starchy foods lead to ameliorated glycemic and insulin responses. There are several dietary schemes available, such as intermittent fasting regimes, which may improve glycemic and insulin responses. Weight loss is important for the treatment of insulin resistance, and it can be achieved by many approaches, such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diets, etc. Lifestyle interventions with small weight loss (7-10%), 150 min of weekly moderate intensity exercise and behavioral therapy approach can be highly effective in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. Similarly, decreasing carbohydrates in meals also improves significantly glycemic and insulin responses, but the extent of this reduction should be individualized, patient-centered, and monitored. Alternative foods or ingredients, such as vinegar, yogurt, whey protein, peanuts and tree nuts should also be considered in ameliorating postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. This review aims to describe the available evidence about the effects of diet, chrononutrition, alternative dietary interventions and exercise on postprandial glycemia and insulin resistance.",

Using the principal component analysis, we identified two patterns from ten lifestyle behaviour questions, namely, the \"diet-smoking\" pattern (including smoking, alcohol drinking, skipping breakfast, eating fast, late dinner, and snacking) and the \"physical activity-sleep\" pattern (including physical exercise, walking equivalent activity, walking fast, and sufficient sleep). Then, individual pattern scores were calculated; the higher the scores, the healthier the behaviours.\nResults: The accumulative incidence rate of T2DM was 630.5 in men and 391.9 in women per 100,000 person-years in an average of 4 years of follow-up. Adjusted for the demographic and cardiometabolic factors at the baseline, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of the highest versus lowest quartile scores of the \"diet-smoking\" pattern for T2DM risk was 0.82 (0.72, 0.92; P for trend = 0.002) in men and 0.87 (0.76, 1·00; P for trend = 0.034) in women; that of the \"physical activity-sleep\" pattern was 0.92 (0.82, 1·04; P for trend = 0.0996) in men and 0.92 (0.80, 1·06; P for trend = 0.372) in women. The \"physical activity-sleep\" pattern showed a significant inverse association in non-overweight men.\nConclusions: Lifestyle behaviour associated with a healthy diet and lack of smoking may significantly lower the risk of T2DM in middle-aged Japanese adults.",

    "abstract": "Aims: Cost-effectiveness (CE) of lifestyle change programs (LCP) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention is influenced by a participant's risk. We identified the risk threshold of developing T2D in the intervention population that was cost-effective for three formats of the LCP: delivered in-person individually or in groups, or delivered virtually. We compared the cost-effectiveness across program formats when there were more than one cost-effective formats.\nMethods: Using the CDC-RTI T2D CE Simulation model, we estimated CEs associated with 3 program formats in 8 population groups with an annual T2D incidence of 1% to 8%. We generated a nationally representative simulation population for each risk level using the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 25-years, to measure the CEs of the programs. We took a health care system perspective.\nResults: To achieve an ICER of $50,000/QALY or lower, the annual T2D incidence of the program participant needed to be ≥5% for the in-person individual program, ≥4% for the digital individual program, and ≥3% for the in-person group program. For those with T2D risk of ≥4%, the in-person group program always dominated the digital individual program. The in-person individual program was cost-effective compared with the in-person group program only among persons with T2D risk of ≥8%.\nConclusions: Our findings could assist decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate target population for different formats of lifestyle intervention programs to prevent T2D.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a global public health crisis that threatens the economies of all nations, particularly developing countries. Fueled by rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the epidemic has grown in parallel with the worldwide rise in obesity. Asia's large population and rapid economic development have made it an epicenter of the epidemic. Asian populations tend to develop diabetes at younger ages and lower BMI levels than Caucasians. Several factors contribute to accelerated diabetes epidemic in Asians, including the \"normal-weight metabolically obese\" phenotype; high prevalence of smoking and heavy alcohol use; high intake of refined carbohydrates (e.g., white rice); and dramatically decreased physical activity levels. Poor nutrition in utero and in early life combined with overnutrition in later life may also play a role in Asia's diabetes epidemic. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology, but currently identified genetic loci are insufficient to explain ethnic differences in diabetes risk. Nonetheless, interactions between Westernized diet and lifestyle and genetic background may accelerate the growth of diabetes in the context of rapid nutrition transition. Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials show that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications. Translating these findings into practice, however, requires fundamental changes in public policies, the food and built environments, and health systems. To curb the escalating diabetes epidemic, primary prevention through promotion of a healthy diet and lifestyle should be a global public policy priority.",

Management should be focused on a multidisciplinary, family-centered approach. Nutrition and exercise counseling should be started at the time of diagnosis and as a part of ongoing management. Metformin is the first-line therapy in conjunction with lifestyle changes. Insulin therapy should be initiated if there are signs of ketosis or ketoacidosis, or if the patient has significant hyperglycemia (A1C greater than 9% or a random plasma glucose level of 250 mg per dL or greater).",

Indeed, the slow and gradual deterioration of glycaemia prior to the diabetes diagnosis constitutes a period during which interventions could be effective in preventing T2D. Lifestyle modifications demonstrated that modest weight loss (at least 7% of initial weight) and moderate to intense physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week, markedly and significantly delayed the onset of T2D in subjects at high risk of developing the disease. Pharmacological interventions indicated that metformin should be considered, particularly in young patients (< 60 years) with a body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m², and in women with a history of gestational diabetes. Bariatric surgery, which allows significant weight loss in subjects with severe or morbid obesity, has also demonstrated important preventive effectiveness and metabolic surgery in now considered in at-risk patients with less severe obesity.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the use of interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes in real-world clinical practice settings and determine the impact on diabetes-related clinical outcomes.\nMethods: The analysis performed in 2020 used 2010‒2018 electronic health record data from 69,434 patients aged ≥18 years at high risk for type 2 diabetes in 2 health systems. The use and impact of prescribed metformin, lifestyle change program, bariatric surgery, and combinations of the 3 were examined. A subanalysis was performed to examine uptake and retention among patients referred to the National Diabetes Prevention Program.\nResults: Mean HbA1c values declined from before to after intervention for patients who were prescribed metformin (-0.067%; p&lt;0.001) or had bariatric surgery (-0.318%; p&lt;0.001). Among patients referred to the National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program, the type 2 diabetes postintervention incidence proportion was 14.0% for nonattendees, 12.8% for some attendance, and 7.5% for those who attended ≥4 sessions (p&lt;0.001). Among referred patients to the National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program, uptake was low (13% for 1‒3 sessions, 15% for ≥4 sessions), especially among males and Hispanic patients.\nConclusions: Findings suggest that metformin and bariatric surgery may improve HbA1c levels and that participation in the National Diabetes Prevention Program may reduce type 2 diabetes incidence.

Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that subjects with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM, and in some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal. Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, both improving cardiovascular risk profile and reducing the risk of T2DM development. These consistent observations have given rise to large-scale randomized controlled trials that use lifestyle intervention (including behavioural strategies for the reinforcement of prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity or both), with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated.",

Therefore, T2DM patients are at an increased risk for CV disease (CVD). Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the treatment of T2DM. This includes lifestyle measures (diet, exercise and smoking cessation) as well as hypolipidaemic, antihypertensive, weight reducing, antiplatelet and glucose lowering drugs. The focus is on the effects of these therapeutic strategies on CVD risk. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) reporting CVD outcomes with such drugs in T2DM patients are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Apart from current guidelines, the findings of RCTs on CVD outcomes in T2DM patients should be taken into consideration in daily clinical practice. Multiple risk factors should be targeted simultaneously in such high-risk patients in order to efficiently reduce the risk of CV events.",

Current approaches to its management and to the prevention of diabetic complications are difficult to implement effectively, and there is little evidence to date that these approaches are reducing the impact of this disease. The recognition that type 2 diabetes usually has a prolonged prediabetic phase raises the possibility that the emergence of hyperglycemia and the atherosclerotic complications associated with diabetes may be preventable by the institution of early treatment modalities. Sufficient data suggest that life-style modification or pharmacotherapy directed at improving insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance may reduce progression to diabetes. Two long-term prospective, controlled trials have been initiated to test this hypothesis.",

Lifestyle modification intervention with reduction of 5%-10% of excess body weight and increase in moderate physical activity by 150 min/wk has consistently proven to reduce the appearance of diabetes in different at-risk populations. Pharmacologic interventions have also demonstrated the prevention of the appearance of diabetes in persons at risk. Bariatric surgery has decreased the appearance of diabetes patients in a select group of individuals. The progression from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus can be prevented.

    "title": "A holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and common mental disorders in Asian women with a history of gestational diabetes: a randomised control trial with 3-year follow-up protocol",
    "abstract": "Background: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 12-fold more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) 4-6 years after delivery than women without GDM. Similarly, GDM is associated with the development of common mental disorders (CMDs) (e.g. anxiety and depression). Evidence shows that holistic lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and mental well-being strategies can prevent T2D and CMDs. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention (mHealth) with post-GDM women in preventing T2D and CMDs in a community setting in Singapore.\nMethods: The study consists of a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 3-year follow-up period. Post-GDM women with no current diabetes diagnosis and not planning to become pregnant will be eligible for the study. In addition, participants will complete mental well-being questionnaires (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep) and their child's socio-emotional and cognitive development. The participants will be randomised to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (comparison). The intervention group will receive the \"LVL UP App\", a smartphone-based, conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention focused on three pillars: Move More (PA), Eat Well (Diet), and Stress Less (mental wellbeing). The intervention consists of health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily \"Life Hacks\" (healthy activity suggestions), slow-paced breathing exercises, a step tracker (including brisk steps), a low-burden food diary, and a journaling tool. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the \"HAPPY App\", a mHealth app which provides health promotion information about PA, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display body mass index, blood pressure, and results from the oral glucose tolerance tests. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 26/27 weeks (midpoint) and a 1-year visit, followed by a 2, 3, and 4-year follow-up period.\nDiscussion: High rates of progression of T2D and CMDs in women with post-GDM suggest an urgent need to promote a healthy lifestyle, including diet, PA, sleep, and mental well-being. Preventive interventions through a holistic, healthy lifestyle may be the solution, considering the inextricable relationship between physical and psychological health. We expect that holistic lifestyle mHealth may effectively support behavioural changes among women with a history of GDM to prevent T2D and CMDs.\nTrial status: The protocol study was approved by the National Healthcare Group in Singapore, Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) [2023/00178]; June 2023.

    "abstract": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is recognized as an effective dietary intervention to reduce blood pressure (BP). However, among randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the DASH diet-mediated BP reduction, there are significant methodological and clinical differences. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively assess the DASH diet effect on BP in adults with and without hypertension, accounting for underlying methodological and clinical confounders. We systematically searched Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library databases and identified 30 RCTs (n = 5545 participants) that investigated the BP effects of the DASH diet compared with a control diet in hypertensive and nonhypertensive adults. Both random-effects and fixed-effect models were used to calculate the mean attained systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) differences during follow-up. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also conducted. Compared with a control diet, the DASH diet reduced both SBP and DBP (difference in means: -3.2 mm Hg; 95% CI: -4.2, -2.3 mm Hg; P < 0.001, and -2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: -3.5, -1.5 mm Hg; P < 0.001, respectively). Hypertension status did not modify the effect on BP reduction. The DASH diet compared with a control diet reduced SBP levels to a higher extent in trials with sodium intake >2400 mg/d than in trials with sodium intake ≤2400 mg/d, whereas both SBP and DBP were reduced more in trials with mean age <50 y than in trials of older participants. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for both outcomes according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The adoption of the DASH diet was accompanied by significant BP reduction in adults with and without hypertension, although higher daily sodium intake and younger age enhanced the BP-lowering effect of the intervention.

    "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in pharmacological treatments, hypertension remains a major cause of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide since elevated blood pressure (BP) adversely influences cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, the current hypertension guidelines recommend the adoption of dietary modifications in all subjects with suboptimal BP levels. These modifications include salt intake reduction and a healthy diet, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), independently of the underlying antihypertensive drug treatment. However, dietary modifications for BP reduction in adults with prehypertension or hypertension are usually examined as stand-alone interventions and, to a lesser extent, in combination with other dietary changes. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the evidence regarding the BP effect of salt restriction in the context of the DASH diet and the MedDiet. We also summarize the literature regarding the effects of these dietary modifications when they are applied as the only intervention for BP reduction in adults with and without hypertension and the potent physiological mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects on BP levels. Available data of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provided evidence about the significant BP-lowering effect of each one of these dietary strategies, especially among subjects with hypertension since they modulate various physiological mechanisms controlling BP. Salt reduction by 2.3 g per day in the DASH diet produces less than half of the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (-3.0/-1.6 mmHg) as it does without the DASH diet (-6.7/-3.5 mmHg). Although their combined effect is not fully additive, low sodium intake and the DASH diet produce higher SBP/DBP reduction (-8.9/-4.5 mmHg) than each of these dietary regimens alone. It is yet unsettled whether this finding is also true for salt reduction in the MedDiet.",

However, the relationship between the DASH diet and mental health and well-being has yet to be systematically understood.\nObjective: To fill this gap, the present review systematically examined the current literature on the association between the DASH diet and mental health.\nData sources: The Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were systematically searched to identify eligible publications up to May 2021. Interventional and observational studies published in English allowing for inferences about mental well-being were included.\nData extraction: Two authors independently assessed the quality of reviewed studies using the NIH quality assessment tool and extracted qualitative data. Conflicts were adjudicated by the senior author.\nData analysis: A total of 16 studies involving 48 824 participants were included in the final review: Ten were observational studies and 6 were randomized controlled trials. On average, the methodological quality of the studies was medium strength. Mixed results on psychological measures were reported, but in general, the DASH diet was associated with better mental well-being. Five observational studies supported a negative association between adherence to the DASH diet and depressive symptoms/depression. Four randomized controlled trials provided evidence of the beneficial effects of the DASH diet on mental health, including quality of life and emotional symptoms.\nConclusion: The DASH diet likely has positive effects on mental well-being, but the results were inconsistent across different studies, which might be likely due to differences in methods of assessments of the DASH diet and mental health outcomes. Well-powered randomized controlled trials with mental well-being as the primary outcome are needed in the future.\nSystematic review registration: PROSPERO registration no. CRD42021267667.",

Such a benefit of DASH diet seemed to be greater in the Asian than in the Western populations (P for interaction = .037). Dose-response meta-analysis indicated a linear association of the DASH diet score with stroke (P for nonlinearity = .411), and each 4-points increment in the score conferred a risk reduction of 4% (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97) in total stroke events.Our findings suggest that higher adherence to the DASH diet is associated with a decreased risk of stroke.",

The current study intended to assess the potential effects of DASH diet on metabolic risk factors in patients with chronic disease.\nData synthesis: We carried out a systematic literature search for RCTs from inception until July 2020. A total of 54 clinical trials were included in the final analysis. Compared to control groups, a significant lower effect of the DASH diet was noted for body weight (-1.59 kg; p < 0.001), BMI (-0.64 kg/m2; p < 0.001), and WC (-1.93 cm; p < 0.001) as well as for SBP (-3.94 mmHg; p < 0.001) and DBP (-2.44 mmHg; P < 0.001).

We studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium, in conjunction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products, in persons with and in those without hypertension.\nMethods: A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet typical of intake in the United States or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high, intermediate, and low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in random order.\nResults: Reducing the sodium intake from the high to the intermediate level reduced the systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mm Hg (P<0.001) during the control diet and by 1.3 mm Hg (P=0.03) during the DASH diet. Reducing the sodium intake from the intermediate to the low level caused additional reductions of 4.6 mm Hg during the control diet (P<0.001) and 1.7 mm Hg during the DASH diet (P<0.01). The effects of sodium were observed in participants with and in those without hypertension, blacks and those of other races, and women and men. The DASH diet was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level; and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones. As compared with the control diet with a high sodium level, the DASH diet with a low sodium level led to a mean systolic blood pressure that was 7.1 mm Hg lower in participants without hypertension, and 11.5 mm Hg lower in participants with hypertension.\nConclusions: The reduction of sodium intake to levels below the current recommendation of 100 mmol per day and the DASH diet both lower blood pressure substantially, with greater effects in combination than singly. Long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of people to make long-lasting dietary changes and the increased availability of lower-sodium foods.",

The aim of the current systematic review was to summarize the findings of previous observational studies and quantify the potential association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of CKD using meta-analysis.\nMethods: A comprehensive search was done with the use of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases to find relevant articles published prior to June 2019. Search terms included: ([Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] OR [DASH]) AND ([Kidney Failure, Chronic] OR [Renal Insufficiency, Chronic] OR [Chronic Kidney Disease], OR [CKD] OR [End-Stage Renal Disease] OR [ESRD] OR [Kidney] OR [Renal]).

Participants were divided into six groups randomized 1:1:1 to the MIM DASH group, attention only (non-hypertensive education) group, or true control group. The MIM DASH and attention only interventions were delivered in 8-weekly 2 hour group sessions. MIM included mindful movements from chair/standing, breathing exercises, and guided meditation. The DASH component used a critical thinking approach of problem solving, goal setting, reflection, and self-efficacy. The true control group received a DASH pamphlet at the end.\nMeasurements: Feasibility was tracked through enrollment and attendance records; acceptability was assessed through interviews. Blood pressure was measured using the Omron HEM-907XL Monitor. Dietary intake was measured by DASH-Q. Mindfulness was measured by the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale. Stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. MCI was determined using the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination.

    "abstract": "Western-type diet with high salt and sugar, sedentary behavior, obesity, tobacco and alcoholism are important risk factors for hypertension. This review aims to highlight the role of western diet-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the role of various types of diets in its prevention with reference to dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet. It seems that it is crucial to alter the western type of diet because such diets can also predispose all CVDs. Western diet-induced oxidative stress is characterized by excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with an altered oxidation-reduction (redox) state, leading to a marked increase in inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Apart from genetic and environmental factors, one important cause for differences in the prevalence of hypertension in various countries may be diet quality, deficiency in functional foods, and salt consumption. The role of the DASH diet has been established. However, there are gaps in knowledge about the role of some Indo-Mediterranean foods and Japanese foods, which have been found to decrease blood pressure (BP) by improving vascular function. The notable Indo-Mediterranean foods are pulses, porridge, spices, and millets; fruits such as guava and blackberry and vegetables, which may also decrease BPs. The Japanese diet consists of soya tofu, whole rice, in particular medical rice, vegetables and plenty of fish rich in fish oil, fish peptides and taurine that are known to decrease BPs. Epidemiological studies and randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated the role of these diets in the prevention of hypertension and metabolic diseases. Such evidence is still meager from Japan, although the prevalence of hypertension is lower (15-21%) compared to other developed countries, which may be due to the high quality of the Japanese diet. Interestingly, some foods, such as berries, guava, pumpkin seeds, carrots, soya beans, and spices, have been found to cause a decrease in BPs. Omega-3 fatty acids, fish peptide, taurine, dietary vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, flavonoids, nitrate and l-arginine are potential nutrients that can also decrease BPs. Larger cohort studies and controlled trials are necessary to confirm our views.",

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern and dietary sodium reduction are recommended as lifestyle interventions in individuals with diabetes. However, these recommendations have largely been based on studies conducted in persons without diabetes. In this review, we summarize available evidence from trials that tested the effects of these 2 dietary interventions on blood pressure in people with diabetes. Overall, of the 3 trials (total n=151) that tested the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern in persons with diabetes, 2 trials documented that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern lowered blood pressure. While 16 trials (total n=445) tested the effects of sodium reduction in persons with diabetes, results were inconsistent, likely because of design limitations, for example, brief duration, small sample size, and low baseline blood pressure levels, as well as differences in the mode of intervention delivery (behavioral interventions, feeding studies, and sodium supplements). In conclusion, there is a substantial need for additional research on the blood pressure lowering effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet and sodium reduction in people with diabetes and hypertension, given the high prevalence of hypertension and the dearth of high-quality trials in this population.",

    "title": "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): potential mechanisms of action against risk factors of the metabolic syndrome",
    "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders dominated by abdominal obesity, hypertriacylglycerolaemia, low HDL-cholesterol, high blood pressure and high fasting glucose. Diet modification is a safe and effective way to treat the metabolic syndrome. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, and low in meats and sweets. DASH provides good amounts of fibre, K, Ca and Mg, and limited quantities of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and Na. Although DASH was initially designed for the prevention or control of hypertension, using a DASH diet has other metabolic benefits. In the present review, the effect of each dietary component of DASH on the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome is discussed. Due to limited fat and high fibre and Ca content, individuals on the DASH diet are less prone to overweight and obesity and possess lower concentrations of total and LDL-cholesterol although changes in TAG and HDL-cholesterol have been less significant and available evidence in this regard is still inconclusive. Moreover, high amounts of fruit and vegetables in DASH provide great quantities of K, Mg and fibre, all of which have been shown to reduce blood pressure. K, Mg, fibre and antioxidants have also been effective in correcting glucose and insulin abnormalities. Evidence is provided from cross-sectional investigations, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials, and, where available, from published meta-analyses. Mechanisms are described according to human studies and, in the case of a lack of evidence, from animal and cell culture investigations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a multifactorial disorder is associated with non-communicable diseases. The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is a healthy dietary pattern. We investigated the effect of the DASH diet on fatty liver and cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with MetS.\nMethods: 60 Subjects with MetS were assigned into the intervention group (DASH diet) or the control group (a healthy diet). Fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), waist circumference (WC), weight, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were evaluated at the beginning and after intervention. Equations of fatty liver indices such as FLI and HSI are based on liver enzymes, anthropometric variables, sex and having diabetes.\nResults: 30 subjects in the intervention group and 29 subjects in the control group completed the study. We found a significant reduction in the intervention group compared to the control group in FLI (-13.06 ± 10.03 vs. -2.90 ± 6.82;P < 0.001), HSI (-2.72 ± 2.59 vs. -0.81 ± 3.80;P = 0.02), WC (-6.02 ± 4.24 vs. -2.24 ± 4.28;P = 0.001), weight (-3.39 ± 2.53 vs. -1.51 ± 2.72;P = 0.008), BMI (-1.25 ± 0.93 vs. -0.56 ± 1.01;P = 0.008), DBP (-5.16 ± 3.92 vs. -1.50 ± 7.04;P = 0.01), SBP (-6.97 ± 8.21 vs. -1.36 ± 6.83;P = 0.006), TG (-18.50 ± 14.32 vs. 0.60 ± 23.81;P < 0.001), TC (-16.10 ± 17.94 vs. -5.07 ± 23.62;P = 0.04) and LDL-c (-13.50 ± 9.58 vs. -4.90 ± 18.28;P = 0.02). These results remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors, except for TC (P = 0.25).\nConclusions: The DASH diet was more effective than the control diet in managing fatty liver and cardiovascular risk factors.\nTrial registration: The trial was registered on 21 October 2022 at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20180201038585N12, URL: https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/66161 ).",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite several epidemiological studies reporting a significant association between adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the risk of diabetes mellitus, the results remain controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence from published observational studies and evaluate the dose-response relationship between adherence to the DASH diet and diabetes mellitus risk.\nMethods: We performed a systematic search for relevant articles published up to September 2023 using electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). A random-effects model was applied to calculate the combined relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest compared to the lowest categories of DASH score in relation to diabetes mellitus risk. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the Cochran's Q test and I-squared (I2) statistic. Literature search, study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers.\nResults: Fifteen studies involving 557,475 participants and 57,064 diabetes mellitus cases were eligible for our analyses. Pooled analyses from included studies showed that high adherence to the DASH diet was significantly associated with a reduced risk of diabetes mellitus (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.76-0.90, P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose-response meta-analysis revealed a linear trend between adherence to the DASH diet and diabetes mellitus (RR:0.99; 95%CI: 0.97-1.02, Pdose-response = 0.546, Pnonlinearity = 0.701). Subgroup analyses further revealed a significant inverse association between adherence to the DASH diet and diabetes mellitus risk in case-control studies (RR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.29-1.43, P < 0.001), with a marginal inverse association in cohort studies (RR:0.83; 95%CI: 0.76-0.91, P < 0.001). Additionally, we conducted analyses separately by comparison and found a significant inverse association between DASH diet and diabetes mellitus risk in T3 vs T1 comparison studies (RR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.64-0.86, P = 0.012).\nConclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate a protective association between adherence to the DASH diet and risk of diabetes mellitus. However, further prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Background & aims: Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with improved blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is proposed that DASH might also improve systemic inflammatory markers like highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); however, interventional studies have led to conflicting results. The aim of current systematic review was to summarize results of randomized clinical trials examining the effect of DASH on inflammatory biomarkers.\nMethods: Randomized trials which assessed the effect of adherence to DASH diet on the circulating inflammatory biomarkers in adults were identified through searching PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Google Scholar up to December 2016. Difference in Mean change and its corresponding standard deviation in inflammatory markers between intervention and control groups were calculated to be used as effect size. Random effects model was used to calculate the summary effects.\nResults: Seven trials were eligible and six studies with 451 participants were included in the meta-analysis which measured hs-CRP as the biomarker of systemic inflammation. The DASH diet significantly decreased serum hs-CRP levels [mean difference (MD) = -1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.64, -0.38; I-squared (I2) = 67.7%] compared to usual diets; however, the effect was not significant when it was compared with healthy diets (MD = 0.10 mg/L; 95%CI: -0.16, 0.37; I2 = 94.0%). The reduction in serum hs-CRP levels was greater in trials lasted eight weeks or more.\nConclusion: Adherence to DASH diet is effective in improving circulating serum inflammatory biomarkers in adults, compared with usual diet; therefore, it could be a valuable strategy to suppress inflammation process.",

This review aims to provide a synopsis of evidence-based dietary approaches that have been effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) in pre-HTN and individuals with HTN.\nRecent findings: Recent dietary recommendations have emphasized overall dietary patterns and its relation between food and BP. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and modifications to the DASH diet, coupled with reductions in sodium intake, show dose-dependent decreases in BP. Implementation of digital lifestyle interventions based on the DASH diet have been effective and show potential for clinical application.\nSummary: Adopting a diet rich in plant-based foods, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and sodium intake within normal limits can be effective in the prevention and management of HTN. These diets have been found to be more effective in older adults and hypertensive persons, particularly in studies that provided meals or frequent dietary counseling.",

This study aimed to analyze the association between the DASH diet and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that the adherence to DASH diet is inversely associated with NAFLD risk. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to find relevant publications up to September 2024. We included observational studies evaluating the association between the DASH diet score and the risk of NAFLD. Pooling effect sizes was conducted using a random effects model to determine the odd ratio (OR) of incident NAFLD associated with the DASH diet. Eight studies with a total of 120937 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for NAFLD in the highest score of the DASH diet vs. lowest score was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.86, P < .001), indicating a significant inverse association between the DASH diet and NAFLD risk. The result was stable to sensitivity analysis. A significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (I2=62.7%, P = .009). Overall, this meta-analysis showed that individuals with the highest score of the DASH diet were 22% less likely to have NAFLD in comparison to those with the lowest score of the DASH diet, independent of body mass index. Further high-quality prospective studies are needed to confirm the protective effect of the DASH diet on NAFLD.",

This paper reports a systematic review of the latest evidence on the method to assess DASH compliance and the corresponding patients' compliance in interventional settings.\nMethods: The databases including MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus were searched for original research studies published in the period of January 1992-December 2012 that evaluated compliance with DASH diet. Studies written in English language, with DASH intervention, with complete documentation of the degree of DASH compliance and the assessment method used were included in this review. The search terms included: dietary approaches to stop hypertension, DASH, compliance, adherence, consistency, and concordance.\nResults: Nine studies were included. Different types of interventions were identified, ranging from feeding trial to dietary counseling. These studies differed in the assessment methods used to evaluate DASH compliance, which included objective approaches like measurement of urinary excretion, and subjective approaches like dietary intake assessment for DASH target comparison and construction of DASH scoring systems. Compliance levels were lower in educational interventions than that of the original DASH feeding trial.\nConclusions: To conclude, although no consensus existed regarding the best approach to assess DASH compliance, its suboptimal compliance warrants attention.

Plant-based diets, like DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension), can help lower the risk of dyslipidemia. However, evidence on the effect of DASH diet on lipid profile in populations with overweight/obesity is inconsistent. This meta-analysis of controlled trials investigated the effects of the DASH diet on lipid profile in individuals with overweight/obesity.\nMethods and results: A search for relevant studies was conducted in databases like PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus until January 2024. The calculation of weighted-mean differences (WMDs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) was performed based on the random-effects model. Sensitivity, meta-regression and publication bias analyses were also conducted. 22 eligible studies with 26 arms and 3562 participants were included. DASH diet significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: 5.05 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 8.78, -1.31, p = 0.008), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD: 5.33 mg/dl, 95 % CI: 8.54, -2.11, p = 0.001) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (WMD: 3.26, 95 % CI: 6.19, -0.34, p = 0.029) levels. Greater reductions were observed in studies with durations ≤8 weeks. All of the included studies were classified as high quality except two, which were classified as moderate quality.

In nonpregnant populations, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is associated with reductions in blood pressure. The present study investigated the relationship between the DASH dietary pattern and maternal BP in pregnancy.\nMethods: This is an observational study of 511 women who participated in the ROLO study (Randomized cOntrol trial of LOw glycaemic index diet for the prevention of recurrence of macrosomia), 2007-2011, Dublin, Ireland. Auscultatory blood pressure, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurements were taken. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated. Dietary intakes were recorded using 3-day food diaries in each trimester. DASH scoring criteria were used to score and rank participants from low to high intakes of foods recommended in the DASH diet. Statistical analysis using analysis of variance and multiple linear regression were used to determine the relationship between maternal BP and DASH scores.\nResults: Dietary intake more closely resembling the DASH dietary recommendations throughout pregnancy was associated with a lower DBP (mmHg) in trimesters 1 [B: -0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.21 to -0.18] and 3 (B: -0.68; 95% CI = -1.19 to -0.17), as well as lower MAP (mmHg) in trimesters 1 (B: -0.78; 95% CI = -1.33 to -0.25) and 3 (B: -0.54; 95% CI = -1.04 to -0.04), controlling for body mass index, age, education, energy intake and intervention grouping.\nConclusions: The DASH dietary pattern was associated with lower maternal BP in pregnancy among healthy women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Despite the observational nature of these findings, the results demonstrate the potential for healthcare professionals to intervene to promote cardiovascular health in pregnancy.",

Attention is gradually shifting to tertiary prevention of CKD to avoid End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) progression. This study reviewed evidence of the use of a Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and its effect on disease progression among patients living with CKD.\nMethods: A comprehensive search was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and EBSCOHost databases for studies published from 1997 to 2025. The PICO framework guided the search, focusing on patients with CKD, DASH as the intervention, other dietary and non-dietary approaches as comparisons, and CKD progression measured by changes in estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and/or Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) as outcomes. Effect sizes with 95 % confidence intervals and pooled effects were calculated using random effects REML models and Z-tests. Percentage changes in renal function post-intervention, based on eGFR, were also computed. Cochran's Q test and the I-squared (I2) statistic assessed study heterogeneity.

All were prospective cohort studies with an average follow-up of 5.5 years and a combined patient sample size of 7033. Across studies, low DASH adherence was defined as scores in the lower half of the possible range used, and high adherence as scores in the upper half (e.g., 0-40 vs. 41-80; 0-4 vs. 5-9; 8-24 vs. 25-40). Low DASH adherence was associated with a mean eGFR improvement of 0.54 ml/min/1.73 m2 (1.2 %) (Z = 0.57, p = 0.57), while high adherence showed a greater improvement of 3.34 ml/min/1.73 m2 (6.8 %) (Z = 1.77, p = 0.08). Only one study assessed UACR, reporting a lower median UACR with high DASH adherence (33.6 mg/g) compared to low adherence (55.6 mg/g).\nConclusions: The DASH diet has the potential to slow CKD progression; however, consistent adherence is crucial to maximize its clinical benefits and improve renal outcomes. Although improvements in eGFR with DASH diet adherence are clinically meaningful, they lack statistical significance. These findings support global efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 for NCDs.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: The evidence of the relationship between dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is limited. Thus, we conducted a cohort-based case-control study to examine whether adherence to the DASH diet was associated with lower NAFLD risk in China.\nMethods: We included 11 888 participants (2529 incident NAFLD and 9359 non-NAFLD) from the Kailuan cohort with no history of hepatitis B/C infection and alcohol drinking. DASH score was calculated based on the energy-adjusted consumption of vegetables, fruits, dairy, beans, grains, meats, fat, sodium and beverage, collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used Logistic regression analysis to determine the NAFLD's risk according to the DASH score.\nResults: Higher DASH score was associated with lower risk of NAFLD. Compared with the lowest quintile of DASH score, the highest DASH quintile had a lower risk of occurring NAFLD, with odds ratio (OR) of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.96) in the multivariate model. Stratified analysis showed that the inverse association was only observed in women (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94), and participants with overweight/obesity (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94), fasting blood glucose <6.1 mmol/L (OR = 0.80, 95%: 0.67-0.96), low density lipoprotein ≥3.4 mmol/L (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.96), high density lipoprotein ≥1.0 mmol/L (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96), ALT < 40 U/L (OR = 0.79, 95% CI:0.67-0.93) and C-reactive protein ≥2.0 mg/L (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.78).\nConclusions: Adherence to the DASH diet was inversely associated with a lower risk of NAFLD in the Chinese population. DASH diet should be highly recommended, especially for women and people with overweight/obesity and a high CRP level.",

    "abstract": "Background & aims: Non-pharmacological measures are recommended as the first-line treatment for individuals with high-normal blood pressure (BP) or mild hypertension. Studies directly comparing the BP effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) vs. the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on a salt restriction background are currently lacking. Thus, our purpose was to assess the BP effects of a 3-month intensive dietary intervention implementing salt restriction either alone or in the context of the DASH, and the MedDiet compared to no/minimal intervention in adults with high normal BP or grade 1 hypertension.\nMethods: We randomly assigned never drug-treated individuals to a control group (CG, n = 60), a salt restriction group (SRG, n = 60), a DASH diet with salt restriction group (DDG, n = 60), or a MedDiet with salt restriction group (MDG, n = 60). The primary outcome was the attained office systolic BP difference among the randomized arms during follow-up.\nResults: A total of 240 patients were enrolled, while 204 (85%) completed the study. According to the intention-to-treat analysis, compared to the CG, office and 24 h ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were reduced in all intervention groups. A greater reduction in the mean office systolic BP was observed in the MDG compared to all other study groups (MDG vs. CG: mean difference = -15.1 mmHg; MDG vs. SRG: mean difference = -7.5 mmHg, and MDG vs. DDG: mean difference = -3.2 mmHg, all P-values <0.001). The DDG and the MDG did not differ concerning the office diastolic BP and the 24 h ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP; however, both diets were more efficient in BP-lowering compared to the SRG.\nConclusions: On a background of salt restriction, the MedDiet was superior in office systolic BP-lowering, but the DASH and MedDiet reduced BP to an extent higher than salt restriction alone.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is known that obesity, sodium intake, and alcohol consumption factors influence blood pressure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure.\nMethods: We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a \"combination\" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels.\nResults: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3+/-10.8 mm Hg and 84.7+/-4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07). Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pressure, > or =140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, > or =90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hypertension, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003).\nConclusions: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure.

    "title": "Impact of Salt Intake on the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Hypertension",
    "abstract": "Excessive dietary salt (sodium chloride) intake is associated with an increased risk for hypertension, which in turn is especially a major risk factor for stroke and other cardiovascular pathologies, but also kidney diseases. Besides, high salt intake or preference for salty food is discussed to be positive associated with stomach cancer, and according to recent studies probably also obesity risk. On the other hand a reduction of dietary salt intake leads to a considerable reduction in blood pressure, especially in hypertensive patients but to a lesser extent also in normotensives as several meta-analyses of interventional studies have shown. Various mechanisms for salt-dependent hypertension have been put forward including volume expansion, modified renal functions and disorders in sodium balance, impaired reaction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and the associated receptors, central stimulation of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and possibly also inflammatory processes.Not every person reacts to changes in dietary salt intake with alterations in blood pressure, dividing people in salt sensitive and insensitive groups. It is estimated that about 50-60 % of hypertensives are salt sensitive. In addition to genetic polymorphisms, salt sensitivity is increased in aging, in black people, and in persons with metabolic syndrome or obesity. However, although mechanisms of salt-dependent hypertensive effects are increasingly known, more research on measurement, storage and kinetics of sodium, on physiological properties, and genetic determinants of salt sensitivity are necessary to harden the basis for salt reduction recommendations.Currently estimated dietary intake of salt is about 9-12 g per day in most countries of the world. These amounts are significantly above the WHO recommended level of less than 5 g salt per day. According to recent research results a moderate reduction of daily salt intake from current intakes to 5-6 g can reduce morbidity rates. Potential risks of salt reduction, like suboptimal iodine supply, are limited and manageable. Concomitant to salt reduction, potassium intake by higher intake of fruits and vegetables should be optimised, since several studies have provided evidence that potassium rich diets or interventions with potassium can lower blood pressure, especially in hypertensives.In addition to dietary assessment the gold standard for measuring salt intake is the analysis of sodium excretion in the 24 h urine. Spot urine samples are appropriate alternatives for monitoring sodium intake. A weakness of dietary evaluations is that the salt content of many foods is not precisely known and information in nutrient databases are limited. A certain limitation of the urine assessment is that dietary sources contributing to salt intake cannot be identified.Salt reduction strategies include nutritional education, improving environmental conditions (by product reformulation and optimization of communal catering) up to mandatory nutrition labeling and regulated nutrition/health claims, as well as legislated changes in the form of taxation.Regarding dietary interventions for the reduction of blood pressure the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet can be recommended. In addition, body weight should be normalized in overweight and obese people (BMI less than 25 kg/m2), salt intake should not exceed 5 g/day according to WHO recommendations (<2 g sodium/day), no more than 1.5 g sodium/d in blacks, middle- and older-aged persons, and individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, intake of potassium (~4.7 g/day) should be increased and alcohol consumption limited. In addition, regular physical activity (endurance, dynamic resistance, and isometric resistance training) is very important.",

We searched thirteen databases, namely, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, KoreaMed, KISS, KMbase, RISS, CINAHL, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Grey Literature Report, OpenGrey and PQDT Global, for articles published through May 2023. The randomised controlled trials assessing the BP-lowering effect of the Na-restricted DASH diet in adults aged 18 years and older were included. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42023409996). The risk of bias in the included studies was also assessed. Nine articles were included in this review. Interventions were categorised into three types: feeding, provision and education, and the study results were compared by intervention type. BP was significantly reduced in two of the three feeding studies, one of the three provisional studies and none of the educational studies. In eight studies, effect sizes varied among both systolic BP (-7·7 to -2·4) and diastolic BP (-8·3 to 0·1). Six studies showed an overall high risk of bias. In conclusion, Na-restricted DASH may have beneficial effects on BP control. Additionally, compared with control interventions, feeding interventions appeared to have a greater BP-lowering effect. Further high-quality studies are needed to improve the quality of the evidence.",

The addition of extra support did not have a statistically significant effect on outcomes.\nConclusions: For adults with hypertension, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and overweight or obesity, the VLC diet resulted in greater improvements in systolic blood pressure, glycemic control, and weight over a 4-month period compared with the DASH diet. These findings suggest that larger trials with longer follow-up are warranted to determine whether the VLC diet might be more beneficial for disease management than the DASH diet for these high-risk adults.",

The purpose of this study was to examine associations between the DASH dietary pattern and bone health outcomes in Chinese elders, to verify whether higher adherence to the DASH was associated with better bone health in elderly populations.\nMaterials and methods: A total of 839 Chinese adults aged 50 years and above participated in this cross-sectional study. Bone mineral density (BMD) at calcaneus was measured via ultrasonic bone densitometer. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess the usual dietary intake in the past 12 months. The DASH score was calculated based on energy-adjusted intakes of nine dietary components, including whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy, red meat, total fat, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages.\nResults: In postmenopausal women, DASH score was significantly and positively correlated with BMD T-score after controlling potential covariates (β: 0.027 ± 0.012, P = 0.031) in multivariable linear regression models.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate adherence to the DASH dietary pattern and examine its association with blood pressure among Australian primary schoolchildren.\nMethod: Cross-sectional data from 658 Australian children aged 8-12 years participating in the Salt and Other Nutrients In Children (SONIC) study were analyzed. One 24-hour diet recall was used to assess dietary intake. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured with a digital automatic blood pressure machine. To assess adherence to the DASH dietary pattern a total DASH score (0-90) was created based on nine nutrient targets (protein, saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, total fiber, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the association between the DASH score and blood pressure.\nResults: The mean total DASH score was 53.1 (SD 10.4) and was significantly different between boys (52.3) and girls (54.0) (p = 0.013).

However, qualitative and quantitative aspects of diet may modulate the association of this polymorphism with obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The aim of this study was to evaluate interactions among MC4R rs17782313, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and risk factors for CVDs. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 266 Iranian women categorized by body mass index (BMI) range of 25-40 kg/m2 as overweight or obese. CVD risk factors included waist circumference (WC), lipid profile, blood pressure, insulin circulation and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Insulin and FBS were used to calculate homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) Body composition was assessed by a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer, InBody 770 scanner. Results: The findings of this study show that high adherence to the DASH diet in the CC groups were associated with decreased SBP and DBP compared to the TT group. In addition, a significant difference between women with high adherence to the DASH diet compared to low adherence was observed for body weight (p < 0.001), fat free mass (FFM) (p = 0.01) and BMI (p = 0.02).

    "abstract": "Background The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to reduce biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to characterize the time course of change in biomarkers of cardiac injury (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I), cardiac strain (NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide]), and inflammation (hs-CRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein]) while consuming the DASH diet. Methods and Results The DASH-Sodium trial was a randomized controlled trial of 412 adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of the DASH diet or a typical American diet. Energy intake was adjusted to maintain body weight. Measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, NT-proBNP, and hs-CRP were performed in stored serum specimens, collected at baseline and ≈4, 8, and 12 weeks after randomization. In both the control diet and DASH diet, levels of NT-proBNP decreased; however, there was no difference between diets (P-trend compared with control=0.22). On the DASH diet versus control, levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I decreased progressively during follow-up (P-trend compared with control=0.025), but a statistically significant between-diet difference in change from baseline levels was not observed until week 12 (% difference, 17.78% [95% CI, -29.51% to -4.09%]). A similar pattern was evident for hs-CRP (P-trend compared with control=0.01; % difference at week 12, 19.97% [95% CI, -31.94% to -5.89%]). Conclusions In comparison with a typical American diet, the DASH diet reduced high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and hs-CRP progressively over 12 weeks. These results suggest that the DASH diet has cumulative benefits over time on biomarkers of subclinical cardiac injury and inflammation.

Nevertheless, no epidemiological studies have investigated the association between this dietary pattern and HNC risk. This study was conducted with the purpose of bridging this gap in knowledge.\nDesign: A prospective cohort study involving 98,459 American adults aged 55 years and older.\nSetting and participants: Data were drawn from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial. In the present study, participants with dependable energy intake data who furnished baseline and dietary history information were identified as the study population.\nMethods: Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaires and the DASH score was calculated to assess each participant's adherence to DASH eating pattern. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the occurrence of HNC. To visualize the variation in cancer risk for HNC and its subtypes across the entire spectrum of DASH scores, restricted cubic spline plots were utilized. Additionally, a series of predefined subgroup analyses were performed to identify potential effect modifiers, and several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the findings.\nResults: During a follow-up period of 871,879.6 person-years, 268 cases of HNC were identified, comprising 161 cases pertaining to oral cavity and pharynx cancers, as well as 96 cases of larynx cancer. In the fully adjusted model, adherence to the DASH diet was associated with a remarkable 57% reduction in the risk of HNC when comparing extreme quartiles (HR quartile 4 vs 1: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.66; P for trend < 0.001). The restricted cubic spline plots demonstrated a linear dose-response relationship between the DASH score and the risk of HNC as well as its subtypes. Subgroup analysis revealed that the protective effect of the DASH diet against HNC was particularly pronounced in individuals with lower daily energy intake. The primary association remained robust in the sensitivity analysis.\nConclusions: In American middle-aged and older population, adherence to the DASH diet may help prevent HNC, particularly for individuals with lower daily energy intake.",

    "abstract": "Dietary patterns consider synergistic effects compared with isolated foods or nutrients on health outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the associations of diet quality as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or incidence, cancer mortality or incidence, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative diseases. A literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE with an end date of May 10, 2014. Study-specific risk ratios were pooled using a random effect model by the Cochrane software package Review Manager 5.2. Fifteen cohort studies (34 reports), including 1,020,642 subjects, met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Diets of the highest quality, as assessed by the HEI, AHEI, and DASH score, resulted in a significant risk reduction (RR) for all-cause mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.80; P<0.00001; I²=61%, 95% CI 20% to 81%), cardiovascular disease (incidence or mortality) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.81; P<0.00001; I²=45%, 95% CI 13% to 66%), cancer (incidence or mortality) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.88; P<0.00001; I²=77%, 95% CI 68% to 84%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.85; P<0.00001; I²=74%, 95% CI 52% to 86%). Differences observed for neurodegenerative diseases were not significant. Egger regression tests provided no evidence of publication bias. Diets that score highly on the HEI, AHEI, and DASH are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus by 22%, 22%, 15%, and 22%, respectively, and therefore is of high public health relevance.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the DASH diet on these health outcomes in women with migraine. Of 102 eligible women (20-50 years), fifty one randomised to the DASH and fifty one to the usual dietary advice (control) groups completed a 12-week intervention. The DASH diet was designed using a 7-d menu cycle to provide 15-20 % of total daily energy requirements from proteins, 25-30 % from fats and 55-60 % from carbohydrates. Dietary records and serum vitamin C levels were used to assess women's compliance with the DASH diet. The clinical symptoms of migraine (i.e., frequency, duration and severity) and quality of life and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) outcomes were assessed in groups pre-and post-intervention. We observed greater decreases in the frequency (-3·00 v. -1·40, P = 0·025) and severity (-1·76 v. -0·59, P < 0·001) of migraine in the DASH v. control group post-intervention. Similarly, the DASH group exhibited a tendency towards greater decreases in migraine duration (-0·58 v. -0·33 d, P = 0·053) and had lower scores of depression (-4·50 v. -2·73, P = 0·019) and stress (-5·84 v. -2·98, P = 0·011) v. controls. However, the quality of life and anxiety outcomes remained comparable in groups post-intervention. Together, evidence supports the benefits of the DASH diet on improving migraine health outcomes in reproductive-aged women. Further research is needed to confirm our findings.",

Proteomic measures may provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms through which the DASH diet reduces blood pressure.\nMethods: The DASH (1994-1996) and DASH-Sodium (1997-1999) trials were multicenter, randomized-controlled feeding trials. Proteomic profiling was conducted in serum collected at the end of the feeding period (DASH, N = 215; DASH-Sodium, N = 390). Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify interactions between 71 DASH diet-related proteins and changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Estimates were meta-analyzed across both trials. Elastic net models were used to identify proteins that predict changes in blood pressure.\nResults: Ten significant interactions were identified [systolic blood pressure: seven proteins; diastolic blood pressure: three proteins], which represented nine unique proteins. A high level of renin at the end of the feeding period was associated with greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure in individuals consuming the control than DASH diets. A high level of procollagen c-endopeptidase enhancer 1 (PCOLCE) and collagen triple helix repeat-containing protein 1 (CTHRC1) were associated with greater reductions in systolic blood pressure in individuals consuming the DASH than control diets, and with elevations in systolic blood pressure in individuals consuming the control diets (P for interaction for all tests < 0.05). Elastic net models identified six additional proteins that predicted change in blood pressure.\nConclusions: Several novel proteins were identified that may provide some insight into the relationship between the DASH diet and blood pressure.",

We examined associations of HL, HN, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet accordance.\nParticipants: Among 1,073 hypertensive adults enrolled in a Baltimore, Maryland-based cohort study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis. Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) measured HL and Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) numeracy score measured HN.\nMethod: DASH accordance was based on nine key nutrients. Linear regression models estimated associations of HL and HN with DASH total and sodium score, inclusive of dietary supplement data.\nResults: In our sample, 39% of participants were male, 66% were Black, 40.2% lived in poverty, and 29.5% reported food insecurity. Fully, 32.5% had limited HL and 14.5% had limited HN. Mean DASH score overall was 2 (range = 0-7.5); only 6.9% were DASH accordant (score ≥4.5). In age and sex adjusted models, higher REALM was associated with a higher DASH score in the overall sample; the relationship of HN with DASH was statistically significant among White but not Black participants. Educational attainment appeared to explain both findings. There were no significant associations between HL or HN and DASH sodium scores.\nConclusion: Differences in educational attainment explained the relation of higher HL and greater accordance to the DASH diet in a population of hypertensive adults.

    "abstract": "Hypertension is the most important, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. High salt intake may predispose children to develop hypertension later. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide would result in a major improvement in public health. Regarding smoking as another risk factor, there are various strategies that can be used to promote smoking cessation. Physicians are in an excellent position to help their patients stop smoking. Targeted weight loss interventions in population subgroups might be more effective for the prevention of hypertension than a general-population approach. A diet rich in high-potassium fruit and vegetables is strongly recommended. Fresh products are best; normal potassium content is reduced when foods are canned or frozen. Calcium supplementation reduces blood pressure in hypertensive individuals during chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition and high calcium diet enhances vasorelaxation in nitric oxide-deficient hypertension. Magnesium should be considered by anyone seeking to prevent or treat high blood pressure. The foundation for a healthy blood pressure consists of a healthy diet, adequate exercise, stress reduction, and sufficient amounts of potassium and magnesium, but further investigations are required before making definitive therapeutic recommendations on magnesium use. Alcohol usage is a more frequent contributor to hypertension than is generally appreciated. For hypertensive patients in whom stress appears to be an important issue, stress management should be considered as an intervention. Individualized cognitive behavioral interventions are more likely to be effective than single-component interventions.",

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern may contribute to managing risk factors of type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effects of DASH diet consumption on the indices of glycemic control such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum fasting insulin level, and Homeostatic Model Assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).\nMethods: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, Science direct, ISI web of science, and Google Scholar for RCTs until July 2012. In total we found 20 articles that examine the effect of DASH diet on FBG (n = 9), fasting insulin (n = 7) and HOMA-IR (n = 4) met the inclusion criteria, respectively.\nResults: Meta-analysis showed that the DASH diet can significantly reduce fasting insulin concentration (mean difference -0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.22 to -0.08; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis based on the study period showed that the DASH diet could significantly reduce fasting insulin levels when prescribed for more than 16 wk (mean difference -0.16; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.08; P < 0.001).

Even in patients with optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, triglycerides remain an important predictor to lower residual cardiovascular risk. In addition to screening, lifestyle intervention, and LDL-C lowering with statins for hypercholesterolemia (and other agents if needed), additional pharmacological therapies may be indicated to lower residual CVD risk in patients with persistent elevated triglyceride levels. Low-dose combinations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid have failed to reduce CVD in primary prevention. A recent trial evaluating high-dose purified EPA (icosapent ethyl) in mild-moderate hypertriglyceridemic statin-treated patients with or at high-risk atherosclerotic CVD demonstrated a clear benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. The recent REDUCE-IT trial shed light on omega-3 therapy. High-dose icosapent ethyl, a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA, reduced the risk of CVD events in statin-treated hypertriglyceridemic patients at elevated cardiovascular risk. Therefore, omega-3 therapy using high-dose icosapent ethyl should be recommended in statin-treated high-risk patients at high residual CVD risk and mild to moderate elevation of triglycerides. While icosapent ethyl demonstrated a benefit in these patients, drug class effect cannot be assumed and further investigations are warranted to examine the effects of other omega-3 agents at high doses.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies have shown that dietary fiber intake is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dietary fiber is a non-digestible form of carbohydrates, due to the lack of the digestive enzyme in humans required to digest fiber. Dietary fibers and lignin are intrinsic to plants and are classified according to their water solubility properties as either soluble or insoluble fibers. Water-soluble fibers include pectin, gums, mucilage, fructans, and some resistant starches. They are present in some fruits, vegetables, oats, and barley. Soluble fibers have been shown to lower blood cholesterol by several mechanisms. On the other hand, water-insoluble fibers mainly include lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose; whole-grain foods, bran, nuts, and seeds are rich in these fibers. Water-insoluble fibers have rapid gastric emptying, and as such may decrease the intestinal transit time and increase fecal bulk, thus promoting digestive regularity. In addition to dietary fiber, isolated and extracted fibers are known as functional fiber and have been shown to induce beneficial health effects when added to food during processing. The recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for total fiber intake for men and women aged 19-50 are 38 gram/day and 25 gram/day, respectively. It is worth noting that the RDA recommendations are for healthy people and do not apply to individuals with some chronic diseases. Studies have shown that most Americans do not consume the recommended intake of fiber.

    "abstract": "Obesity has risen to epidemic levels worldwide over the past few decades and has become a huge global health burden owing to its direct contribution to the development of some of the most prevalent chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and other cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a disease of positive energy balance resulting from complex interactions between abnormal neurohumoral responses and an individual's socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic factors leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Understanding the complex nature of the disease is crucial in determining the best approach to combat its rising numbers. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological therapy for the treatment of obesity, reversing weight gain and maintaining weight loss is challenging due to the relapsing nature of the disease. Prevention, therefore, remains the key which needs to start in utero and continued throughout life. This review summarizes the role obesity plays in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases both by directly affecting endothelial and myocyte function and indirectly by enhancing major cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. We highlight the importance of a holistic approach needed to prevent and treat this debilitating disease. Particularly, we analyse the effects of plant-based diet, regular exercise, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis on obesity and overall cardiorespiratory fitness. Moreover, we discuss the significance of individualizing obesity management with a multimodal approach including lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery to tackle this chronic disease.",

Patients with NAFLD have increased mortality when compared to the general population, primarily related to cardiovascular disease or malignancy. The biologic mechanisms that link NAFLD to cardiovascular disease include expansion of visceral adipose tissue, atherogenic dyslipidemia, impaired insulin signaling, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Currently, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD. It has recently been hypothesized that reducing the delivery of dietary cholesterol using the hypolipidemic agent, ezetimibe, could benefit patients with NAFLD. By potently inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) sterol receptor on intestinal enterocytes and within the liver, ezetimibe blocks exogenous cholesterol absorption and has been shown to improve biochemical markers of NAFLD, improve insulin sensitivity and decrease hepatic steatosis.

    "title": "Cardiovascular disease risk reduction by raising HDL cholesterol--current therapies and future opportunities",
    "abstract": "Since the first discovery of an inverse correlation between high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and coronary heart disease in the 1950s the life cycle of HDL, its role in atherosclerosis and the therapeutic modification of HDL-C levels have been major research topics. The Framingham study and others that followed could show that HDL-C is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and that the increase of HDL-C of only 10 mg·L(-1) leads to a risk reduction of 2-3%. While statin therapy and therefore low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction could lower coronary heart disease considerably; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality still occur in a significant portion of subjects already receiving therapy. Therefore, new strategies and therapies are needed to further reduce the risk. Raising HDL-C was thought to achieve this goal. However, established drug therapies resulting in substantial HDL-C increase are scarce and their effect is controversial. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that HDL particle functionality is at least as important as HDL-C levels since HDL particles not only promote reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery (mainly macrophages) to the liver but also exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation, haemostasis and apoptosis. This review deals with the biology of HDL particles, the established and future therapeutic options to increase HDL-C and discusses the results and conclusions of the most important studies published in the last years. Finally, an outlook on future diagnostic tools and therapeutic opportunities regarding coronary artery disease is given.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Inclisiran is a novel nonstatin therapy providing significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as improvements in other lipid biomarkers. This review summarizes data from postapproval publications regarding the impact of inclisiran on lipids and cardiovascular risk reduction, as well as its tolerability and cost-effectiveness.\nMethods: A search of PubMed for inclisiran was used to identify articles published since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical research studies reporting meta-analysis; pooled patient-level trial analyses; cost-effectiveness analyses; new human data; prespecified, post-hoc, or subgroup trial analyses; and clinical trial extensions were included.\nFindings: The search identified 153 citations; 16 studies were included. FDA-approval trials, subsequent pooled patient-level trial analyses, and extension studies found that inclisiran, administered with and without maximally tolerated statin therapy, reduced LDL-C by ≈50%, with the reduction sustained for 4 years. Inclisiran appeared to be well tolerated, even long-term, with injection-site reactions being the most common adverse effect. A patient-level pooled analysis of data from Phase III trials suggested that cardiovascular events were reduced with inclisiran versus placebo (7.1% vs 9.4%; odds ratio = 0.74 [95% CI, 0.58-0.94]). Inclisiran is suggested to be cost-effective based the presumed cardiovascular benefit commensurate with LDL-C reduction.\nImplications: The cardiovascular benefit and cost-effectiveness of inclisiran are promising, though not definitive. The results of a large-scale study of the effects of inclisiran on cardiovascular outcomes are expected in 2026; until then, the nonstatin therapies primarily prescribed for LDL-C reduction remain proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK)-9 inhibitors and ezetimibe. However, inclisiran is a reasonable alternative to, PCSK-9 inhibitors, in patients who struggle with the self-injection of or adherence to PCSK-9 inhibitors as inclisiran maintenance therapy is administered twice yearly by a health care professional.",

An increase in prevalent cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension and diabetes) has led to a concerted effort to raise awareness of the need to use evidence-based strategies to help patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease and to reduce their likelihood of suffering a stroke. Sleep apnea has emerged as an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic and clinical evidence has prompted the American Heart Association to issue a scientific statement describing the need to recognize sleep apnea as an important target for therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease risks. This article examines evidence supporting associations of sleep apnea with cardiovascular disease and considers evidence suggesting cardiovascular risk reductions through sleep apnea treatment.

This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of such interventions in modifying parent and child/adolescent risk factors such as body mass index, physical activity, dietary intakes and alcohol use. Five electronic databases were searched up to April 2020. Of 2193 articles identified, seven randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Data were extracted regarding study setting, design, methods, eHealth technology used, intervention and control group components, retention rates, outcome measures, incentives and limitations. Risk of bias and quality assessment were carried out using Cochrane methods. A qualitative narrative data synthesis of the studies was conducted. Our review found that three studies showed an improvement in alcohol use among parents and adolescents as a result of the eHealth intervention. Among children/adolescents, two studies showed an improvement in dietary intake, one study showed an improvement in physical activity, and one study showed an improvement in body mass index as a result of the eHealth intervention. Interventions appeared more likely to be effective if they were theory-based, had longer follow-up periods, were incentivised and included regular interaction. Our findings suggest that, despite a paucity of high-quality trials, there is some evidence that family-based eHealth interventions have potential to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

    "abstract": "Purpose of review: Cardiovascular events are the major cause of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Individuals with CKD have a substantially greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population but have largely been excluded from clinical trials. This review highlights the complex pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, discusses the evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction and assesses the achievement of cardiovascular treatment targets in CKD.\nRecent findings: There is evidence to support both blood pressure and cholesterol reduction in the CKD population. The risk of bleeding with antiplatelet drugs is high in CKD and these should be used with caution. Although there has been recent interest in targeting nonclassical cardiovascular risk factors in CKD, few trials have demonstrated any significant reduction in cardiovascular risk. Smoking cessation remains important but is poorly studied in CKD with many dialysis patients still smoking.\nSummary: The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in CKD differs subtly from that of non-CKD patients. As renal function declines, the role and impact of treating classical risk factors may change and diminish. However, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking cessation management should be optimized and may require multiple agents and approaches, particularly as CKD advances. Treatment of hypertension would appear to be one management area in which performance is less than ideal. Future work should focus on new management strategies and drug combinations that tackle the classical risk factors as well as better designed longitudinal and randomized control trials of nonclassical risk factors. Patients with CKD should be included in all cardiovascular intervention studies, given their poor outcomes without interventions.",

We conducted a review of the literature with respect to observational studies and randomized trials completed in the past ≈25 years that examined nut intake and CVD endpoints. We included findings from major cohort studies, a large intervention trial, and numerous smaller nut trials. Collectively, data from observational and intervention studies indicate strong and significant association between nut intake and decreased risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and sudden death; and somewhat weak association with stroke. The primary mechanism by which nuts protect against CVD is through the improvement of lipid and apolipoprotein profile. Increasing evidence also indicates that nut consumption may confer protection against CVD via lowering of oxidative stress, inflammation, and improvement in endothelial function. Nut components, such as unsaturated fatty acids, l-arginine, beneficial minerals, phenolic compounds and phytosterols, appear to be of paramount importance for their health effects.",

Randomized trials attempting to modulate other lipids beyond LDL-C have failed to demonstrate significant reductions in ischemic events.\nRecent findings: Mounting evidence suggests that triglyceride elevation is an independent risk factor for ASCVD. Though trials of triglyceride-lowering therapy in the statin era have failed to provide protection from ASCVD events, subgroup analyses have revealed that those with the highest triglycerides at time of enrollment appeared to receive the greatest clinical benefit. REDUCE-IT was a trial that enrolled patients with high triglycerides despite having goal LDL-C levels on statin therapy. Treatment with icosapent ethyl, a highly purified omega-3 fatty acid (OM3FA), eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, provided a 25% relative risk reduction for the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.68--0.83; P = 0.00000001), as well as a 30% relative risk reduction in total ischemic events (P = 0.00000000036).\nSummary: Icosapent ethyl was rigorously shown to decrease residual risk for cardiovascular events, though the benefits seen were likely because of mechanisms beyond mere triglyceride lowering. Clinical application of icosapent ethyl in this cohort of patients with residual risk is urgently needed.",

Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; <1.03 mmol/l or <40 mg/dl) are an independent risk factor for CVD, and raising levels of HDL-C is a major treatment strategy for regressing atherosclerosis and enhancing CVD risk reduction. This can be achieved by both nonpharmacological lifestyle measures and pharmacological treatment strategies.\nRecent findings: This article will focus on the currently available and emerging pharmacological treatment strategies for raising HDL-C. Extended-release nicotinic acid (or Niacin) remains the most effective pharmacological treatment currently available for elevating HDL-C, having recently been combined with simvastatin (as Simcor) and laropripant (as Cordaptive, to reduce flushing). Other HDL-C-raising agents in current clinical use or in clinical development are fibrates, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, and HDL-C mimetics. Novel pharmacological targets for raising HDL-C also include the nuclear liver X and farnesoid X receptors and endothelial lipase.\nSummary: Novel well tolerated and efficacious treatment strategies for raising HDL-C are required to target atherosclerosis and enhance CVD risk reduction.",

Participants favored initial in-person face-to-face interactions with a nurse practitioner that could transition to phone-based meetings and Skype. In addition, participants underscored that confidentiality can be a concern in small communities and therefore community health workers need to be trusted individuals. Calls for additions to COACH materials were very specific and participants underscored the need for social support.\nConclusions: With minor adaptations, the COACH program can be pilot tested in rural settings to address key health concerns and behaviors that affect risk for cardiovascular health.",

The focus groups were video and audio recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was used to synthesize and identify key categories and subcategories regarding development of and engagement with an eHealth programme. Three categories emerged: experiences of health apps and devices; eHealth application needs of family members; and motivators for using an eHealth programme. Experiences included using health apps individually and inconsistently. Needs included personalization, free and easy-to-use, time efficient, and multiple content formats.

In this scientific statement from the American Heart Association, we provide rationale for the widespread adoption of rapid diet screener tools in primary care and relevant specialty care prevention settings, discuss the theory- and practice-based criteria of a rapid diet screener tool that supports valid and feasible diet assessment and counseling in clinical settings, review existing tools, and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating a rapid diet screener tool into clinician workflows through the electronic health record.",

Trials comparing different dietary approaches indicated that reducing carbohydrate intake promoted greater initial weight loss than other approaches but did not appear to significantly improve long-term outcomes. Food provision appears to enhance adherence to reduction in energy intake and produce greater initial weight losses. The long-term benefits of food provision are less clear. Trials comparing alternative treatment modalities suggest that phone-based treatment produce short- and long-term weight reductions equivalent to face-to-face interventions. The use of Internet and mobile technologies are associated with smaller reductions in body weight than face-to-face interventions. Based on this review, clinical implications and future research directions are provided.",

The pathophysiological basis of cardiovascular health among men and women is not identical. This leads to variable cardiovascular responses to stimulus and presentation of cardiovascular disease symptoms, both of which can have a direct effect on treatment outcomes. Traditionally, the enrollment of women in clinical trials has been minimal, resulting in a lack of gender-specific analysis of clinical trial data and, therefore, the absence of concrete risk factor assessment among women. However, scientific progress in the past decade has identified a spectrum of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases that may be specific to women. These risk factors, which may include menopause, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, and depression, confer additional risk in women besides the traditional risk factors. The current state of knowledge and awareness about these risk factors is suboptimal at this time. Therefore, although the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is similar in both genders, appropriate risk stratification may be limited in women compared to men. The purpose of this review is to describe the recent trends in identifying female-specific risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, their utility in risk stratification, and current pharmacological options for women with regard to cardiovascular disease prevention.",

    "abstract": "Obesity in the United States is increasing, with the most recent national data indicating a prevalence of 41.9%. Obesity is generally considered a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg per m2 or greater; however, increased waist circumference (female: 35 inches or greater; male: 40 inches or greater) may be a more accurate indicator of obesity, particularly in older adults. For patients who are overweight or obese, the history should include whether patients are taking medications that can increase weight and identifying comorbid conditions contributing to or resulting from obesity. Clinicians should also ask about previous weight-management strategies and whether they were effective. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, metabolic profile, lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone and A1C levels, and additional testing as needed. The Obesity Medicine Association recommends that weight management incorporate five pillars: behavioral counseling, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and, when appropriate, bariatric procedures. Pharmacotherapy with anti-obesity medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sympathomimetics, and others should be considered for any patient with a BMI of 30 kg per m2 or greater and for any patients who are overweight (i.e., BMI of 27 kg per m2 or greater) with metabolic comorbidities. Referral for bariatric surgery should be considered for patients who meet the criteria.

    "title": "Obesity Management in Adults: A Review",
    "abstract": "Importance: Obesity affects approximately 42% of US adults and is associated with increased rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, and premature death.\nObservations: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater is commonly used to define overweight, and a BMI of 30 or greater to define obesity, with lower thresholds for Asian populations (BMI ≥25-27.5), although use of BMI alone is not recommended to determine individual risk. Individuals with obesity have higher rates of incident cardiovascular disease. In men with a BMI of 30 to 39, cardiovascular event rates are 20.21 per 1000 person-years compared with 13.72 per 1000 person-years in men with a normal BMI. In women with a BMI of 30 to 39.9, cardiovascular event rates are 9.97 per 1000 person-years compared with 6.37 per 1000 person-years in women with a normal BMI. Among people with obesity, 5% to 10% weight loss improves systolic blood pressure by about 3 mm Hg for those with hypertension, and may decrease hemoglobin A1c by 0.6% to 1% for those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence-based obesity treatment includes interventions addressing 5 major categories: behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures. Comprehensive obesity care plans combine appropriate interventions for individual patients. Multicomponent behavioral interventions, ideally consisting of at least 14 sessions in 6 months to promote lifestyle changes, including components such as weight self-monitoring, dietary and physical activity counseling, and problem solving, often produce 5% to 10% weight loss, although weight regain occurs in 25% or more of participants at 2-year follow-up. Effective nutritional approaches focus on reducing total caloric intake and dietary strategies based on patient preferences. Physical activity without calorie reduction typically causes less weight loss (2-3 kg) but is important for weight-loss maintenance. Commonly prescribed medications such as antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, amitriptyline) and antihyperglycemics such as glyburide or insulin cause weight gain, and clinicians should review and consider alternatives. Antiobesity medications are recommended for nonpregnant patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. Six medications are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term use: glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1) agonists (semaglutide and liraglutide only), tirzepatide (a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 agonist), phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, and orlistat. Of these, tirzepatide has the greatest effect, with mean weight loss of 21% at 72 weeks. Endoscopic procedures (ie, intragastric balloon and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty) can attain 10% to 13% weight loss at 6 months. Weight loss from metabolic and bariatric surgeries (ie, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) ranges from 25% to 30% at 12 months. Maintaining long-term weight loss is difficult, and clinical guidelines support the use of long-term antiobesity medications when weight maintenance is inadequate with lifestyle interventions alone.\nConclusion and relevance: Obesity affects approximately 42% of adults in the US. Behavioral interventions can attain approximately 5% to 10% weight loss, GLP-1 agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor agonists can attain approximately 8% to 21% weight loss, and bariatric surgery can attain approximately 25% to 30% weight loss. Comprehensive, evidence-based obesity treatment combines behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures as appropriate for individual patients.",

Findings suggest that in Canada, obesity continues to be treated as a self-inflicted risk factor, which affects the type of interventions and approaches that are implemented by governments or covered by private health plans. The lack of recognition of obesity as a chronic disease by Canadian public and private payers, health systems, employers, and the public, has a trickle-down effect on access to evidence-based prevention and treatment. Although there is increasing recognition and awareness about the impact of weight bias and obesity stigma on the health and social well-being of Canadians, interventions are urgently needed in education, healthcare, and public policy sectors. We conclude by making recommendations for the advancement of evidence-based obesity prevention and management policies that can improve the lives of Canadians affected by obesity.",

Effective obesity management is essential to mitigate associated comorbidities and improve quality of life. The pillars of obesity treatment encompass lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions. Pharmacotherapy may be considered for women who do not achieve adequate weight loss through lifestyle changes alone and have obesity or overweight with risk factors. Bariatric surgery is reserved for individuals with severe obesity or those with obesity-related complications. During menopause, hormonal changes contribute to weight gain and fat redistribution, complicating obesity management. Tailored treatment strategies are necessary to address the unique challenges faced by this population. The role of physicians and gynecologists is pivotal in the multidisciplinary approach to obesity management during menopause. Gynecologists are often the primary health-care providers for menopausal women and are in a unique position to offer guidance on weight management. They can provide personalized counseling, coordinate with nutritionists, endocrinologists and bariatric specialists, and monitor the effects of obesity and its treatment on reproductive health. By integrating obesity management into routine gynecological care, gynecologists can significantly impact the overall health and well-being of menopausal women.",

    "abstract": "The goal of obesity management is to improve health. Sustained weight loss of more than 10% overall bodyweight improves many of the complications associated with obesity (eg, prevention and control of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea), as well as quality of life. Maintenance of weight loss is the major challenge of obesity management. Like all chronic diseases, managing obesity requires a long-term, multimodal approach, taking into account each individual's treatment goals, and the benefit and risk of different therapies. In conjunction with lifestyle interventions, anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery improve the maintenance of weight loss and associated health gains. Most available anti-obesity medications act on central appetite pathways to reduce hunger and food reward. In the past 5 years, therapeutic advances have seen the development of targeted treatments for monogenic obesities and a new generation of anti-obesity medications. These highly effective anti-obesity medications are associated with weight losses of more than 10% of overall bodyweight in more than two-thirds of clinical trial participants. Long-term data on safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular outcomes are awaited. Long-term studies have shown that bariatric surgical procedures typically lead to a durable weight loss of 25% and rapid, sustained improvements in complications of obesity, although they have not yet been compared with new-generation highly effective anti-obesity medications. Further work is required to determine optimal patient-specific treatment strategies, including combinations of lifestyle interventions, anti-obesity medications, endoscopic and bariatric surgical procedures, and to ensure equitable access to effective treatments.",

The therapeutic armamentarium for obesity primarily consists of 4 forms of therapy: lifestyle modification (ie, diet and exercise), cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery.\nEvidence acquisition: Evidence was consolidated from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses.\nEvidence synthesis: After 2 years, lifestyle interventions can facilitate weight loss that equates to ~5%. Even though lifestyle interventions are plagued by weight regain, they can have substantial effects on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk. Although 10-year percentage excess weight loss can surpass 50% after bariatric surgery, weight regain is likely. To mitigate weight regain, instituting a multifactorial maintenance program is imperative. Such a program can integrate diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy. Moreover, behavioral therapy can complement a maintenance program well.\nConclusions: Obesity is best managed by a multidisciplinary clinical team that integrates diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy.

The VLCKD is characterized by a low carbohydrate content (<50 g/day), 1-1.5 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight, 15-30 g of fat/day, and a daily intake of about 500-800 calories.\nObjectives: The aim of the current document is to suggest a common protocol for VLCKD and to summarize the existing literature on its efficacy in weight management and weight-related comorbidities, as well as the possible side effects.\nMethods: This document has been prepared in adherence with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Literature searches, study selection, methodology development, and quality appraisal were performed independently by 2 authors and the data were collated by means of a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.\nResults: Of the 645 articles retrieved, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed, revealing 4 main findings. First, the VLCKD was shown to result in a significant weight loss in the short, intermediate, and long terms and improvement in body composition parameters as well as glycemic and lipid profiles. Second, when compared with other weight loss interventions of the same duration, the VLCKD showed a major effect on reduction of body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, total cholesterol and triglyceridemia as well as improved insulin resistance. Third, although the VLCKD also resulted in a significant reduction of glycemia, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol, these changes were similar to those obtained with other weight loss interventions. Finally, the VLCKD can be considered a safe nutritional approach under a health professional's supervision since the most common side effects are usually clinically mild and easily to manage and recovery is often spontaneous.\nConclusions: The VLCKD can be recommended as an effective dietary treatment for individuals with obesity after considering potential contra-indications and keeping in mind that any dietary treatment has to be personalized.

Obesity increases the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, pulmonary disease, hepatobiliary disease, cancer, and a number of psychosocial complications.

Practical office-based strategies include: (1) making recommendations for assisted self-management, including guidance on popular diets, (2) advising patients about commercial weight-loss programs, (3) advising patients about and prescribing medications, (4) recommending bariatric surgery, and (5) supplementing these strategies with counseling about lifestyle changes using a systematic approach.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global epidemic that has worsened over the past few decades. It is strongly associated with multiple health conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, obstructive sleep apnoea, certain malignancies and has an increased mortality risk. The annual cost of obesity to the NHS is around £6 billion, projected to increase to just under £10 billion by 2050. In 2020-2021, obesity was cited as a factor in over 1 million hospital admissions. An early and pragmatic approach to the management of obesity would reduce obesity-associated multiple health conditions and result in cost savings for the NHS. Here, we discuss current management strategies for obesity, including dietary intervention, pharmacological therapies and optimisation, and bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Despite the commonly-accepted paradigm that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also invariably have obesity, OSA prevalence extends beyond obesity. This necessitates a reevaluation of screening strategies, biomarkers of increased OSA risk, and heightened awareness among healthcare providers about the array of OSA treatments for diverse adult populations. While obesity contributes importantly to OSA pathogenesis, there is substantial evidence that non-anatomical factors also play a crucial role, especially in patients who do not have obesity. In recent years, notwithstanding the recognition of diverse contributors to OSA pathogenesis, research has frequently focused on weight reduction to address OSA. Insights from past experiences with bariatric surgery in OSA serve as a lens to anticipate potential outcomes of emerging anti-obesity pharmacotherapies. Pharmacological alternatives, particularly incretin agonists, exhibit promise in weight reduction and OSA improvement, but encounter obstacles such as potential side effects and high costs. With this comprehensive narrative review, we delve into the complex epidemiological and pathophysiological connections between OSA and obesity. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of a multifaceted approach to OSA treatment, recognizing that while weight management is crucial, there is a need for comprehensive strategies that go beyond traditional weight-centric perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has emerged as a major metabolic disorder threatening global public health, with gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis recognized as a key pathogenic driver. While existing reviews have explored associations between GM and obesity (e.g., the gut-liver axis), this review focuses specifically on polyphenols to establish a novel paradigm of \"GM-targeted polyphenol interventions.\" Naturally occurring polyphenols exhibit unique advantages in obesity management; however, their systemic effects critically depend on GM-mediated biotransformation. Herein, we propose the \"Polyphenol-GM Axis\" as the core mechanism underpinning polyphenol efficacy against obesity, synthesizing and integrating current evidence. This comprehensive review elucidates how polyphenols from diverse sources ameliorate obesity through GM modulation: (1) remodeling gut-liver crosstalk via bile acid metabolism; (2) inhibiting lipogenesis through GM-derived metabolites; (3) restoring intestinal barrier integrity; (4) blocking inflammatory cascades. We elucidate causal relationships between polyphenol-induced GM shifts and host metabolic outcomes, revealing targeted pathways for bidirectional \"microbiota-host\" regulation. Critically, we propose that combining GM-targeted polyphenol interventions with lifestyle modifications (diet/exercise) enables precision nutrition. This paradigm provides a theoretical foundation for developing polyphenol-based therapeutics beyond nutritional supplements. Future research should prioritize personalized GM modulation and structural optimization of polyphenols to accelerate their translation from functional foods to clinical agents for obesity management.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are major public health concerns associated with serious morbidity and increased mortality. Both obesity and T2DM are strongly associated with adiposopathy, a term that describes the pathophysiological changes of the adipose tissue. In this review, we have highlighted adipose tissue dysfunction as a major factor in the etiology of these conditions since it promotes chronic inflammation, dysregulated glucose homeostasis, and impaired adipogenesis, leading to the accumulation of ectopic fat and insulin resistance. This dysfunctional state can be effectively ameliorated by the loss of at least 15% of body weight, that is correlated with better glycemic control, decreased likelihood of cardiometabolic disease, and an improvement in overall quality of life. Weight loss can be achieved through lifestyle modifications (healthy diet, regular physical activity) and pharmacotherapy. In this review, we summarized different effective management strategies to address weight loss, such as bariatric surgery and several classes of drugs, namely metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, amylin analogs, and SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs act by targeting various mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of obesity and T2DM, and they have been shown to induce significant weight loss and improve glycemic control in obese individuals with T2DM.",

    "abstract": "There has been a major increase in Type 2 diabetes and obesity in many countries, and this will lead to a global public health crisis, which not only impacts on the quality of life of individuals well but also places a substantial burden on healthcare systems and economies. Obesity is linked to not only to type 2 diabetes but also cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and certain cancers, also resulting in increased medical costs and diminished quality of life. A number of studies have linked changes in gut in obesity development. Dysbiosis, a deleterious change in gut microbiota composition, leads to altered intestinal permeability, associated with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Many factors affect the homeostasis of gut microbiota, including diet, genetics, circadian rhythms, medication, probiotics, and antibiotics. In addition, bariatric surgery induces changes in gut microbiota that contributes to the metabolic benefits observed post-surgery. Current obesity management strategies encompass dietary interventions, exercise, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, with emerging treatments including microbiota-altering approaches showing promising efficacy. While pharmacotherapy has demonstrated significant advancements in recent years, bariatric surgery remains one of the most effective treatments for sustainable weight loss. However, access to this is generally limited to those living with severe obesity. This underscores the need for non-surgical interventions, particularly for adolescents and mildly obese patients. In this comprehensive review, we assess longitudinal alterations in gut microbiota composition and functionality resulting from the two currently most effective anti-obesity treatments: pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. Additionally, we highlight the functions of gut microbiota, focusing on specific bacteria, their metabolites, and strategies for modulating gut microbiota to prevent and treat obesity. This review aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of obesity management and the potential of microbiota-based approaches in addressing this pressing global health challenge.",

    "abstract": "Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive age women. Although its cardinal manifestations include hyperandrogenism, oligo/anovulation, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology, PCOS women often display also notable metabolic comorbidities. An array of pathogenic mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of this heterogeneous endocrine disorder; hyperandrogenism at various developmental periods is proposed as a major driver of the metabolic and reproductive perturbations associated with PCOS. However, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of PCOS-associated metabolic disease is incomplete, and therapeutic strategies used to manage this syndrome's metabolic complications remain limited.\nScope of review: This study is a systematic review of the potential etiopathogenic mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction frequently associated with PCOS, with special emphasis on the metabolic impact of androgen excess on different metabolic tissues and the brain. We also briefly summarize the therapeutic approaches currently available to manage metabolic perturbations linked to PCOS, highlighting current weaknesses and future directions.\nMajor conclusions: Androgen excess plays a prominent role in the development of metabolic disturbances associated with PCOS, with a discernible impact on key peripheral metabolic tissues, including the adipose, liver, pancreas, and muscle, and very prominently the brain, contributing to the constellation of metabolic complications of PCOS, from obesity to insulin resistance. However, the current understanding of the pathogenic roles of hyperandrogenism in metabolic dysfunction of PCOS and the underlying mechanisms remain largely incomplete. In addition, the development of more efficient, even personalized therapeutic strategies for the metabolic management of PCOS patients persists as an unmet need that will certainly benefit from a better comprehension of the molecular basis of this heterogeneous syndrome.",

A literature search was performed using the key words obesity, weight loss, CVD, cardiometabolic, and risk factors and included key clinical trials from the past 5 years. Obesity management through weight loss is associated with improvements in CVD risk factors, such as improved blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control, with greater weight loss leading to greater improvements in CVD risk factors. Bariatric surgery is associated with greater weight loss than the other procedures and treatments for obesity, and for this, and possibly for other reasons, it is associated with greater reductions in CVD outcomes and mortality. Obesity is an independent risk factor and modulator of other CVD risk factors, and thus, treatment of obesity should be an integral part of management strategies to reduce CVD risk. Future trials and real-world studies of longer duration are needed to inform providers and patients on how to individualize the approach to modifying risks of cardiometabolic disorders through obesity management.",

Although body mass index is typically used to assess obesity in clinical practice, altered body composition (eg, reduced muscle mass and increased visceral adiposity) are common among patients with CKD. Weight loss achieved through behavioral modification or medications reduces albuminuria and in some cases slows the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of medications that promote weight loss with favorable cardiovascular risk profiles should be promoted, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and CKD. For those who fail to achieve weight loss through lifestyle modification, bariatric surgery should be considered because observational studies have shown reductions in risk for estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and kidney failure. Uncertainty persists on the risk to benefit ratio of intentional weight loss in patients with kidney failure due to the lack of prospective trials and limitations of observational data. Regardless, sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly being used for patients with kidney failure and severe obesity, with success in achieving sustained weight loss, improved access to kidney transplantation, and favorable posttransplantation outcomes. More research is needed assessing long-term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of most weight loss medications.",

The management of obesity includes; lifestyle modification, psychological therapy, pharmacological therapy, and bariatric surgery. To date, bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity by offering a long-term reduction in weight, remission of obesity-related complications, and improving quality of life. However, bariatric surgery is not equally effective in all patients. Thus, if we can predict who would benefit most, it will improve the risk versus benefit ratio of having surgery.\nAreas covered: In this narrative review, we explore the question on who will benefit the most from bariatric surgery by examining the recent evidence in the literature. In addition, we investigate the predisposing predictors of bariatric surgery response. Finally, we offer the best strategies in the clinic to explain the potential benefits of bariatric surgery to patients.\nExpert opinion: Bariatric surgery is an effective obesity management approach. Despite its efficacy, considerable variation of individual response exists. Thus, it is important to recognize patients that will benefit most, but at present very few predictors are available which can be clinically useful.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a complex chronic relapsing disease, resulting from the interaction between multiple environmental, genetic and epigenetic causes, and supported by changes in the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating energy balance and body weight. Adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to obesity-related complications. However, the prevalent narrative about the causes and mechanisms of obesity remains a much more simplistic one, based on the false assumption that individuals can fully control their body weight through appropriate behavioural choices. According to this narrative, obesity is simply reversible \"persuading\" the patient to follow healthier and more virtuous individual behaviours (moral judgement). This persistent narrative forms the deep root of the stigmatisation of people with obesity at the individual level and creates a clear discrepancy on how obesity prevention and cure are designed in comparison with the case of other non-communicable chronic diseases (clinical stigma). The promotion of systemic preventive measures against obesity is not supported at a political and social level by the persistence of a narrative of obesity as the simple consequence of individual failures and lack of willpower. The simplistic narrative of obesity as a self-imposed condition with an easy way-out (\"eat less and move more\") creates a clear discrepancy on how obesity is managed by health care systems in comparison with other NCDs. The over-estimation of the efficacy of therapeutic intervention solely based on patients education and lifestyle modification is responsible of therapeutic inertia in health care professionals and in clinical guidelines, limiting or delaying the adoption of more effective therapeutic strategies, like anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery. In conclusion, the persistence of a narrative describing obesity as a self-induced easily reversible condition has profound consequences on how obesity prevention and management are build, including the design and implementation of obesity management guidelines and a tendency to therapeutic inertia.Level of evidence: No level of evidence.",

    "title": "Update in the management of obesity",
    "abstract": "Significant increase of obesity prevalence in almost all countries in the world recently has had obesity as a global health problem, and WHO in 1998 defined it as \"the global epidemic\". Simply, obesity is defined as an excessive fat accumulation in fat tissue due to imbalance of energy intake and expenditure. Body mass index is a simple method for defining the degree of overweight and obesity, however, waist circumference is the preferred measure of abdominal obesity because it has greater relationship with the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Body fatness reflects the interactions of development, environment and genetic factors. The role of genetic factors has already existed, nevertheless, environment factors are likely more important in developing obesity. Increased mortality among the obese is evident for several life-threatening diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, and hormone-sensitive and gastrointestinal cancers. Risks are also higher for some non-fatal conditions such as back pain, arthritis, infertility and, in many westernized countries, poor psychosocial functioning. Obesity is not only threatening health, also impacts on high economic and social cost. Effective prevention of obesity should be focused to high risk individuals or groups. Individuals who have some existing weight-related problems and those with a high risk of developing obesity co-morbidity such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes should be a key priority in this prevention strategy. Although weight loss in obese persons of any age can improve obesity-related medical complications, physical function, and quality of life, the primary purpose for weigh-loss therapy may differ across age group. The current therapeutic tools available for weight management are: (1) lifestyle intervention involving diet, physical activity, and behavior modification; (2) pharmacotherapy; and (3) surgery. Moderate weight loss (5-10% of initial weight) by any programs is a realistic target in management of obesity associated with improvement of risk factors of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.",

Traditional management strategies, including dietary, exercise, and behavioral interventions, often result in insufficient and unsustainable weight loss. Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of obesity management, providing the foundation for other strategies. While options such as bariatric surgery remain an effective intervention for severe obesity, it is associated with its own set of risks and is typically reserved for patients who have not achieved the desired results with pharmacotherapy and lifestyle interventions. Incretin hormone agonists represent a significant advancement in the pharmacotherapy of obesity, offering substantial weight reduction and cardiometabolic benefits. Agents like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide supported by key clinical trials such as Satiety and Clinical Adipose Liraglutide Evidence (SCALE), Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) program trials, and Tirzepatide Once Weekly for the Treatment of Obesity (SURMOUNT-1) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in promoting weight loss and improving metabolic outcomes. Additionally, novel therapies, including dual and triple incretin agonists, are under investigation and hold the potential for further advancements in obesity treatment.

Four themes were explored: the burden of obesity among dialysis patients, concepts of healthy weight loss, weight loss approaches, and challenges of obesity management in dialysis settings. Respondents were asked to rank approaches and biomarkers for obesity management from 0 (least important or not used) to 100 (most important). Free text fields were provided in each category for additional comments.\nResults: Thirty-one renal dietitians responded to the survey (26% response rate). The majority of respondents (90%) indicated that access to kidney transplantation was the main reason that dialysis patients with obesity desired weight loss. Calorie restriction was rated as the most common weight loss approach, and dry weight as the most important weight loss biomarker. Nearly 40% of respondents do not alter their nutritional approach when dialysis patients with obesity are losing weight, and 42% of respondents do not monitor changes in waist circumference. Exercise, diet counseling, and stress management were variably prioritized as weight loss management strategies. Barriers to obesity management in dialysis settings included lack of time, lack of training in weight loss counseling, and gaps in current renal nutritional guidelines.\nConclusion: Despite the high prevalence of obesity among individuals with end-stage kidney disease, the results of this survey suggest that current approaches to obesity management in dialysis settings are highly variable. Many renal dietitians lack time to counsel patients on healthy weight loss strategies. Nutritional guidelines are also needed to support people with dialysis dependence and obesity who desire or require weight loss.",

    "title": "Precision nutrition for obesity management: A gut microbiota-centered weight-loss approach",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic burdens and cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on precision nutrition as a strategy for obesity management, exploring how personalized interventions can modulate the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota composition directly impact lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory pathways, and appetite regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, the review discusses the relationship between gut microbiota and dietary factors, highlighting how certain types of diets (such as the Mediterranean diet and fiber-rich diets) can promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the growth of beneficial bacteria associated with weight regulation and reduced inflammation. While diet is the primary factor modulating the gut microbiota, factors such as genetics and epigenetic characteristics, body composition, maternal nutritional, type of birth delivery, physical activity and even drug use also play significant roles in this modulation. Although the use of precision nutrition approaches still faces challenges, such as cost and variability in individual response, the integration of omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning appear to offer great potential as tools to identify specific microbial and genetic profiles that allow for the personalization of nutritional interventions. These technologies enable large-scale analysis of dietary, genomic, and microbial factors to create dietary strategies to prevent or treat obesity that meet the specific metabolic needs of each individual. Thus, the application of these tools in clinical settings could transform obesity management, creating data-driven interventions that enhance treatment effectiveness.",

    "title": "Nutritional Challenges of Incretin-Based Obesity Management Medications: Implications for Clinical Practice",
    "abstract": "Several novel incretin-based obesity management medications (OMMs) have recently been approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight. These agents have demonstrated substantial weight reduction effects alongside glucoregulatory and cardioprotective benefits. However, the use of incretin-based OMMs presents nutritional challenges that remain insufficiently addressed. These include side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances and loss of lean body mass, which may compromise nutritional status, reduce energy expenditure, and heighten risk of rebound weight gain, sarcopenia, and frailty. Moreover, although these medications effectively suppress energy intake and reduce food quantity, they may also have unintended effects on diet quality, potentially influencing macronutrient distribution, ultraprocessed food consumption, risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and disordered eating behaviors, which could undermine long-term weight maintenance and the cardiometabolic benefits achieved through these pharmacotherapy agents. Emerging evidence suggests that specific dietary and behavioral strategies, such as higher protein intake, resistance training, nutrient-dense eating patterns, and fostering adaptive eating behaviors, may help mitigate nutritional challenges and physiologic deterioration during significant weight reduction while also supporting cardiometabolic health maintenance. However, the application of these strategies as adjunct treatments alongside the new OMMs remains unclear. This narrative review summarizes the current literature on these issues and proposes dietary interventions and behavioral modification strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse effects that can be associated with incretin-based OMMs. These considerations are increasingly important given the expanding use of these medications, the degree of weight reduction they induce, and the implications for specific at-risk groups, including aging populations prone to muscle and functional decline and individuals with pre-existing conditions of nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and disordered eating patterns.",

More than 60 genes coding for proteins located in the hypothalamic leptin/melanocortin pathway contribute to the development of these rare forms of obesity. The ambition of the French National Protocol for the Diagnosis and Care (PNDS) of Obesity of Rare Causes was to establish practical recommendations for assessment and management at all ages. This report is available on the website of the French Health Authority (HAS). In addition to severe obesity, patients often display obesity-related comorbidities and neuropsychological/psychiatric disorders. These complex conditions make clinical management particularly challenging. Early diagnosis is critical for the organization of coordinated specialized multidisciplinary care, with mandatory interaction between caregivers, social partners and families. Strategies to prevent aggravation of obesity consist in limiting access to food, establishing a reassuring daily eating environment, and the practice of sustained adapted supervised daily physical activity. The implementation of genetic diagnosis in clinical practice now enables a personalized medicine approach with access to new drug therapies, and improves the analysis of the risk/benefit ratio of bariatric surgery.",

As such, they have a special role to play within the organizations in which they work as leaders in the approach to managing obese patients. Recent epidemiological data demonstrate that the prevalence of obesity is beginning to plateau. However, the rate of severe obesity in adults and the prevalence of overweight among children continue to grow, suggesting that in the future there will be an increasing burden of obesity-related illnesses. A number of recent studies have identified a number of novel mechanisms that predispose to obesity including several newly identified genes, the role of intestinal microflora, and even social networks. The selection of treatment for obese patients remains a complex issue. Recent studies demonstrate that a range of dietary approaches including the Atkins diet can provide modest weight loss, although the key feature appears to be adherence in the dietary strategy. High levels of physical activity appear to be necessary to maintain a reduced state, although modest increases in activity improve fitness. Although the new understanding of biology of weight regulation has provided a wide range of potential drug targets, available pharmacotherapy options remain limited although a number of potential targets show promise. Recent data provides the most enthusiasm for surgical treatment of obesity. Several recent studies demonstrate a reduction in mortality and dramatic benefits in diabetes in obese patients treated surgically. Questions remain as to the best surgical approach and the cost effectiveness. Research advances in obesity continue to move at a rapid pace and raise hopes for more effective management strategies in the future.",

    "abstract": "In the U.S., the occurrence of weight counseling in primary care for patients with obesity decreased by 10% between 1995-1996 and 2007-2008. There have been several national recommendations and policies to improve obesity management since 2008. The purpose of this study was to examine the rates of body mass index (BMI) screening, obesity diagnosis, and weight management counseling in the U.S. from 2008 to 2013. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey visit-level data for adults 18 and over with a primary care visit during survey years 2008-2009, 2010-2011, and 2012-2013 was included in the analyses using SAS v9.3. Study outcomes included percent of visits with: BMI screening; obesity diagnosis; and weight counseling. We compared survey years on these outcomes using 2008-2009 as the reference as well as examined patient and practice-level predictors. Analyses were conducted from 2015 to early 2017. Of the total 55,608 adult primary care visits sampled, 14,143 visits (25%) were with patients with obesity. BMI screening significantly increased between 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 from 54% to 73% (OR=1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.41); however, percent of visits with an obesity diagnosis remained low at <30%. Weight management counseling during visits significantly declined from 33% to 21% between 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.92). Despite emerging recommendations and policies, from 2008 to 2013, obesity management in primary care remained suboptimal. Identifying practical strategies to enforce policies and implement evidence-based behavioral treatment in primary care should be a high priority in healthcare reform.",

Although literature exists for decision-making on various obesity management topics, there are no scoping reviews systematically mapping the literature. This scoping review is timely given that the treatment of obesity has evolved into a multidisciplinary endeavor with myriad management decisions that both patients and clinicians must navigate.\nInclusion criteria: The review will consider for inclusion full-text primary studies, published in English from the year 2000 onwards, pertaining to decision-making in obesity management for health care providers involved in obesity management for patients aged ≥18 years.\nMethods: This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Embase (Elsevier), MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate), CINAHL Complete (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and Cochrane Central (Wiley) will be systematically searched using a predefined strategy. Two independent reviewers will conduct a 3-tiered screen of identified articles, with a third reviewer resolving disputes. Data extraction will be performed using a predefined, yet flexible form.

    "abstract": "Background: Obesity, a pervasive global health challenge affecting more than 2 billion people, requires comprehensive interventions. Traditional approaches, including lifestyle modification, and diverse drugs targeting a gastrointestinal hormone, including glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (Liraglutide, Semaglutide, Exenatide, Albiglutide, Dulaglutide, Lixisenatide, Orlistat, Phentermine/Topiramate, Lorcaserin, Sibutramine, and Rimonabant) offer tailored strategies; yet their effectiveness is limited and some drugs were taken off the market. Moreover, various surgical modalities, such as Roux-en-Y Bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy, intragastric balloons, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and vagal nerve blockade can be considered but are associated with numerous side effects and require careful monitoring. Consequently, there is a pressing need for novel anti-obesity treatments.\nMethods: This comprehensive review was based on the available data to discuss the traditional pharmaceutical and surgical therapeutical strategies for obesity, going further to discuss tirzepatide's mode of action, its outcomes for obesity, and the associated side effects.\nResults: In this landscape, tirzepatide, initially designed for type 2 diabetes management, emerges as a potential game-changer. Functioning as a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, it not only addresses control but also introduces a fresh perspective on weight reduction. This review intricately explores tirzepatide's mechanism, dissecting insights from clinical studies and positioning it as a major force in obesity treatment.\nConclusions: In the middle of significant shifts in obesity management, tirzepatide presents itself as a promising and cost-effective intervention. Its Food and Drug Administration approval marks a milestone in the realm of obesity therapeutics. Going beyond a recapitulation of findings, the conclusion emphasizes the imperative for ongoing exploration and vigilant safety monitoring in tirzepatide's application.",

    "abstract": "Although the caloric deficits achieved by increased awareness, policy, and environmental approaches have begun to achieve reductions in the prevalence of obesity in some countries, these approaches are insufficient to achieve weight loss in patients with severe obesity. Because the prevalence of obesity poses an enormous clinical burden, innovative treatment and care-delivery strategies are needed. Nonetheless, health professionals are poorly prepared to address obesity. In addition to biases and unfounded assumptions about patients with obesity, absence of training in behaviour-change strategies and scarce experience working within interprofessional teams impairs care of patients with obesity. Modalities available for the treatment of adult obesity include clinical counselling focused on diet, physical activity, and behaviour change, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Few options, few published reports of treatment, and no large randomised trials are available for paediatric patients. Improved care for patients with obesity will need alignment of the intensity of therapy with the severity of disease and integration of therapy with environmental changes that reinforce clinical strategies. New treatment strategies, such as the use of technology and innovative means of health-care delivery that rely on health professionals other than physicians, represent promising options, particularly for patients with overweight and patients with mild to moderate obesity. The co-occurrence of undernutrition and obesity in low-income and middle-income countries poses unique challenges that might not be amenable to the same strategies as those that can be used in high-income countries.",

In addition, we considered the clinical and public health impacts of the MedDiet on both human and planetary health. Earlier research confirmed by recent studies has provided strong evidence for the benefits of the MedDiet on cardiovascular health, including reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes as well as risk factors including obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidaemia. There is also evidence that MedDiet is associated with lower rates of incident diabetes, and better glycaemic control in diabetic patients compared to control diets. In prospective studies, adherence to the MedDiet reduced mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality, hence increased longevity. In addition, it has been associated with less age-related cognitive dysfunction and lower incidence of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the relatively low environmental impacts (water, nitrogen and carbon footprint) of the MedDiet is an additional positive aspect of the Mediterranean dietary model.

Although there are challenges with isolating the MD from the typical Mediterranean lifestyle and culture (including prolonged 'social' meals and siestas), much evidence supports the health benefits of the MD that include improved longevity, reduced metabolic risk of Diabetes Mellitus, obesity, and Metabolic Syndrome, reduced risk of malignancy and cardiovascular disease, and improved cognitive function. The MD is also associated with characteristic modifications to gut microbiota, mediated through its constituent parts (primarily dietary fibres, extra virgin olive oil, and polyunsaturated fatty acids [including ω-3]). These include enhanced growth of species that produce short-chain fatty acids (butyrate), such as Clostridium leptum and Eubacterium rectale, enhanced growth of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species, and reduced growth of Firmicutes and Blautia species. Such changes in gut microbiota are known to be associated favourably with inflammatory and oxidative status, propensity for malignancy and overall metabolic health. A key challenge for the future is to explore the extent to which the health benefits of the MD are mediated by such changes to gut microbiota. The MD confers both health and environmental benefits. Adoption of the MD should perhaps be encouraged and facilitated more generally and not just restricted to populations from Mediterranean regions. However, there are key challenges to this approach that include limited perennial availability of the constituent parts of the MD in some non-Mediterranean regions, intolerability of a high-fibre diet for some people, and potential cultural disconnects that juxtapose some traditional (including Western) diets with the MD.",

    "abstract": "Aims: To address potential controversies on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) after PREDIMED, a randomized trial of MedDiet for primary cardiovascular prevention. We have focused on: a) the PREDIMED study design, b) analysis of PREDIMED data and c) interpretation of its results.\nData synthesis: Regarding the design of the trial, its early termination and between-group differences in the intensity of the intervention are potential causes of concern. The planned duration was 6 years but the trial was prematurely stopped when an interim analysis at 4.8-year provided sufficient evidence of benefit for the two MedDiets. In the MedDiet groups supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed-nuts, the primary composite endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) was reduced by 30% and 28% respectively, as compared with the control group. Final results did not change after taking into account the different intensity of educational efforts during the trial. Other potential doubts related to data analysis (e.g., intention to treat versus a per-protocol approach, and consequences of dropouts) should not be causes of concern. Finally, we addressed alternative interpretations of the effect on all-cause mortality. The protocol-defined primary endpoint was a composite cardiovascular endpoint, not all-cause mortality. To analyze total mortality, we would have needed a much larger sample size and longer follow-up. Therefore, the PREDIMED results cannot be used to draw firm conclusions on MedDiets and all-cause mortality.\nConclusions: The PREDIMED study was designed to overcome three major problems of previous nutritional research: a) residual confounding, addressed by using a randomized design; b) single-nutrient approaches, by randomizing an overall dietary pattern; and c) the limitations of assessing only intermediate risk markers, by using hard clinical end-points.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To present the Mediterranean diet (MD) pyramid: a lifestyle for today.\nDesign: A new graphic representation has been conceived as a simplified main frame to be adapted to the different nutritional and socio-economic contexts of the Mediterranean region. This review gathers updated recommendations considering the lifestyle, dietary, sociocultural, environmental and health challenges that the current Mediterranean populations are facing.\nSetting and subjects: Mediterranean region and its populations.\nResults: Many innovations have arisen since previous graphical representations of the MD. First, the concept of composition of the 'main meals' is introduced to reinforce the plant-based core of the dietary pattern. Second, frugality and moderation is emphasised because of the major public health challenge of obesity. Third, qualitative cultural and lifestyle elements are taken into account, such as conviviality, culinary activities, physical activity and adequate rest, along with proportion and frequency recommendations of food consumption. These innovations are made without omitting other items associated with the production, selection, processing and consumption of foods, such as seasonality, biodiversity, and traditional, local and eco-friendly products.\nConclusions: Adopting a healthy lifestyle and preserving cultural elements should be considered in order to acquire all the benefits from the MD and preserve this cultural heritage. Considering the acknowledgment of the MD as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (2010), and taking into account its contribution to health and general well-being, we hope to contribute to a much better adherence to this healthy dietary pattern and its way of life with this new graphic representation.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To characterize the multiple dimensions and benefits of the Mediterranean diet as a sustainable diet, in order to revitalize this intangible food heritage at the country level; and to develop a multidimensional framework - the Med Diet 4.0 - in which four sustainability benefits of the Mediterranean diet are presented in parallel: major health and nutrition benefits, low environmental impacts and richness in biodiversity, high sociocultural food values, and positive local economic returns.\nDesign: A narrative review was applied at the country level to highlight the multiple sustainable benefits of the Mediterranean diet into a single multidimensional framework: the Med Diet 4.0. Setting/subjects We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that contained data on the characterization of sustainable diets and of the Mediterranean diet. The methodological framework approach was finalized through a series of meetings, workshops and conferences where the framework was presented, discussed and ultimately refined.\nResults: The Med Diet 4.0 provides a conceptual multidimensional framework to characterize the Mediterranean diet as a sustainable diet model, by applying principles of sustainability to the Mediterranean diet.\nConclusions: By providing a broader understanding of the many sustainable benefits of the Mediterranean diet, the Med Diet 4.0 can contribute to the revitalization of the Mediterranean diet by improving its current perception not only as a healthy diet but also a sustainable lifestyle model, with country-specific and culturally appropriate variations. It also takes into account the identity and diversity of food cultures and systems, expressed within the notion of the Mediterranean diet, across the Mediterranean region and in other parts of the world. Further multidisciplinary studies are needed for the assessment of the sustainability of the Mediterranean diet to include these new dimensions.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is the best evidence-based model for cardiovascular prevention. In addition to 2 major randomized secondary prevention trials (Lyon Heart and CORDIOPREV) and 1 primary prevention trial (PREDIMED) that have demonstrated these benefits, there is an unprecedented body of high-quality prospective epidemiological evidence supporting these beneficial effects. The key elements of this traditional pattern are the abundant use of extra-virgin olive oil and high consumption of foods of natural plant-based origin (fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes) and fish, along with a reduction in processed meats, red meats, and ultraprocessed products. Moderate consumption of wine, preferably red wine, with meals is an essential element of this traditional pattern. Although removing wine consumption from the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a reduction in its preventive efficacy, doubts have recently arisen about the possible adverse effect of even low or moderate intake of any alcoholic beverages. A new large Spanish trial, UNATI, which will begin in June 2024, will randomize 10 000 drinkers aged 50 to 75 years to abstention or moderate consumption. UNATI aims to answer these doubts with the best possible evidence.",

    "title": "Mediterranean Diet for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: An Updated Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with coronary heart disease being the primary cause. The Mediterranean Diet (MD) has been highlighted for its potential in providing greater protection against CVDs. This study aims to present an updated systematic review that examines the impact of MD on mortality and CVDs, both in the general population and in patients with a prior CVD, while also considering the potential influence of gender. We conducted a systematic review. After the selection process, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings from these studies consistently demonstrate that higher adherence to the MD is associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality, both in the general population and in patients with previous CVDs. Moreover, evidence suggests that following this dietary pattern likely decreases the risk of CVDs such as heart attacks, various types of coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. While some studies have identified differences in the benefits of the MD between men and women, it is important to note that these disparities may be attributed to lower event rates and a generally lower cardiovascular risk profile in women. Thus, the observed variations in outcomes should be interpreted in the context of these factors. Adherence to the MD has the potential to improve survival rates and reduce the risk of CVDs in both the general population and individuals with a prior CVD. Further research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms underlying the protective effects of this dietary pattern and to better understand the role gender-related differences in its outcomes. Nevertheless, promoting the adoption of the MD could be an effective strategy for mitigating the burden of CVDs globally.",

Beyond evidence on individual food substitutions, an emerging body of literature points out that adopting a plant-forward Mediterranean diet may further amplify the positive health effects of the overall dietary pattern. Additionally, although the MedDiet is recognized as an environmentally sustainable pattern, a fully plant-based version could further reduce its environmental impact and resource use compared to an omnivorous diet. The MedDiet is widely recognized for its health benefits, particularly in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions. These benefits are largely attributed to its emphasis on whole, plant-based foods. Although evidence is limited, current findings suggest that reducing the animal-based content of the traditional MedDiet, along with the increase in whole plant-based food, could lead to enhanced health benefits. Furthermore, the reduction in environmental pollution and resources overused could contribute to broader public health and sustainability. Long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative health effects of these dietary patterns.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR), defined as an attenuated biological response to circulating insulin, is a fundamental defect in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and is also linked to a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cognitive impairment, endothelial dysfunction, chronic kidney disease (CKD), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and some endocrine tumors, including breast cancer. In obesity, the unbalanced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipocytokines can lead to the development of IR and its related metabolic complications, which are potentially reversible through weight-loss programs. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), characterized by high consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), nuts, red wine, vegetables and other polyphenol-rich elements, has proved to be associated with greater improvement of IR in obese individuals, when compared to other nutritional interventions. Also, recent studies in either experimental animal models or in humans, have shown encouraging results for insulin-sensitizing nutritional supplements derived from MedDiet food sources in the modulation of pathognomonic traits of certain IR-related conditions, including polyunsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and seeds, anthocyanins from purple vegetables and fruits, resveratrol from grapes, and the EVOO-derived, oleacein. Although the pharmacological properties and clinical uses of these functional nutrients are still under investigation, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the metabolic benefits appear to be compound-specific and, in some cases, point to a role in gene expression through an involvement of the nuclear high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) protein.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been previously proven to have various health-related benefits; however, its effect on women's reproductive health over a lifespan is yet to be summarized. This study aimed to summarize the evidence-based knowledge regarding the association between the MD and selected reproductive health outcomes. By searching PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, as well as reference lists, 21 studies were included in this narrative review. The available evidence was very limited; however, there is some suggestion that higher adherence to the MD may be positively associated with a lower risk of early age menarche (1 study) and shorter menstrual cycles (1 study), but is unrelated to dysmenorrhea (1 study). Moreover, no study to date has examined the relationship between the MD and the onset age of natural menopause. Considering reproductive health diseases, there was limited evidence that a higher adherence to the MD was associated with a lower risk of premenstrual syndrome (1 study), an improvement in sexual health and a lower prevalence of sexual dysfunction (3 studies), and an improvement in the general condition of with endometriosis and the pain they can experience (1 study). The largest number of studies were found for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS; 7 studies) and infertility (6 studies). Results showed that a higher adherence to the MD was associated with a lower risk of infertility, while results for PCOS were unclear, but mostly indicated a beneficial trend. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of adherence to the MD in reproductive health maintenance and its possible role in the prevention and treatment of reproductive health diseases in women.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of review: Chronic noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the majority are preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but controversy remains as to the best approach. Greater adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Despite the well known benefits on chronic disease risk there remains some scepticism as to the effects of this dietary pattern across populations outside the Mediterranean and the mechanisms of action of this traditional plant-based dietary pattern.This narrative review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the health protective effects of a traditional Mediterranean diet on chronic noncommunicable diseases, specifically focussing on the anti-inflammatory effects of this highly published dietary pattern.\nRecent findings: Recent high-quality evidence now supports a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with impacts on atherosclerosis progression, likely through reduction of systemic inflammation and irrespective of changes in cholesterol or weight. The Mediterranean diet has a low Dietary Inflammatory Index illustrating its anti-inflammatory potential. This dietary pattern beneficially modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, including emerging evidence for efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Emerging evidence shows clinicians are not routinely recommending a Mediterranean diet despite well known evidence due to barriers such as lack of training, patient materials and concerns about potential patient adherence.\nSummary: The physiological mechanisms of action of this healthy diet pattern are becoming better understood to be multisystem and involving the gut. Larger controlled trials investigating mechanistic effects in broader non-Mediterranean populations are warranted. Although reflected in therapeutic guidelines for chronic disease management worldwide there are individual, clinical practice and health system barriers to its implementation that need a multisectoral approach to address.",

This review offers a glimpse of the onset of the Mediterranean diet and follows its significant impact on the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. There is a constant rise in type 2 diabetes cases on the Balkan Peninsula and North Macedonia in particular. Having in mind that North Macedonia, as well as most of the countries on the Balkans have low to middle income, there is a need for a certain affordable dietary pattern to ameliorate the rise in diabetes incidence, as well as improve the glycemic control.

    "abstract": "Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia pose a significant global health, social, and economic challenge. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically been viewed as the leading cause of dementia, recent evidence reveals the considerable impact of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), which now accounts for nearly half of all dementia cases. The Mediterranean diet-characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil-has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits and may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. To investigate the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive health, we conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. The studies included in the meta-nalysis examined the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the incidence of dementia and AD. We applied a random-effects model to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed heterogeneity through I-square statistics. Forest plots, funnel plots, and Z-score plots were used to visualize study outcomes. Of the 324 full-text records reviewed, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR for cognitive impairment among those adhering to the Mediterranean diet was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89); for dementia, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95); and for AD, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.82), indicating substantial protective effects. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, though Z-score plots suggested sufficient sample sizes to support reliable conclusions for each condition. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with an 11-30% reduction in the risk of age-related cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD. These findings underscore the Mediterranean diet's potential as a central element in neuroprotective public health strategies to mitigate the global impact of cognitive decline and dementia and to promote healthier cognitive aging.",

The effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function has been seen in primary prevention. However, no scientific evidence is currently available to determine which dietary pattern is more effective in the management of CKD in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the long-term consumption of two healthy dietary patterns (a Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) compared to a low-fat diet rich in complex carbohydrates) in preserving kidney function in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients.\nMethods: CHD patients (n = 1002) from the CORDIOPREV study were randomized to follow a Mediterranean diet (35% fat, 22% MUFA, <50% carbohydrates) or a low-fat diet (28% fat, 12% MUFA, >55% carbohydrates). Kidney function was assessed by the determination of serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and after 5-years of dietary intervention. Patients were classified according to their type 2 diabetes (T2DM) status, using baseline eGFR (normal eGFR: ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; mildly-impaired eGFR: 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, severely-impaired eGFR: <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) to evaluate its influence on the progression of kidney function. Multiple linear regression analysis were performed to determine the contribution of different clinical and anthropometric parameters to changes in eGFR.\nResults: Although eGFR declined after both dietary interventions compared to baseline (all p < 0.001), the Mediterranean diet produced a lower decline of eGFR compared to the low-fat diet in patients with T2DM (p = 0.040). This effect was also observed when the overall population was considered (p = 0.033). No significant differences were observed in eGFR between the two diets in non-T2DM patients. In addition, this differential effect of the Mediterranean diet was mainly observed in patients with mildly-impaired eGFR in which this diet slowed eGFR progression (p = 0.002).\nConclusions: The long-term consumption of a Mediterranean diet rich in EVOO, when compared to a low-fat diet, may preserve kidney function, as shown by a reduced decline in eGFR in CHD patients with T2DM. Patients with mildly-impaired eGFR may benefit more from the beneficial effect of the consumption of the Mediterranean diet in preserving kidney function. These findings reinforce the clinical benefits of the Mediterranean diet in the context of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.\nClinical trial registration: URL, http://www.cordioprev.es/index.php/en.

Studies have shown significant reductions in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) among individuals adhering to the MD, suggesting its pivotal role in mitigating chronic inflammation-associated with cancer development. Furthermore, the MD's anti-angiogenic properties, particularly in components like olive oil, red wine, fish, and tomatoes, offer promising avenues for reducing GC risk by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, the MD's influence on intestinal microbiota composition underscores its potential in maintaining immune homeostasis and reducing systemic inflammation, factors crucial in GC prevention. Despite challenges such as variability in dietary adherence scoring systems and the need for further gender and geographical-specific studies, evidence supports the MD as a cost-effective and holistic approach to GC prevention.

The huge body of scientific evidence about the health benefits of the MedDiet model and principles requires a comprehensive framework to encompass the scientific reliability and robustness of this tool. A systematic review was carried out to examine the association between human health and adherence to MedDiet patterns upon which the \"Med-Index\" tool was subsequently developed.\nMethods: MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for eligible publications from 1990 to April 2023. Systematic literature reviews, with or without meta-analysis, of clinical trials and observational studies were screened by two independent investigators for eligibility, data extraction, and quality assessment. English language and the time interval 1990-2023 were applied. A registry code CRD42023464807 was generated on PROSPERO and approved for this search protocol. The corrected covered area (CCA), calculated to quantify the degree of overlap between reviews, gave a slight overlap (CCA = 4%).\nResults: A total of 84 systematic reviews out of 6681 screened records were selected. Eligible reviews included studies with predominantly observational designs (61/84, 72.6%%), of which 26/61 referenced studies of mixed observational and RCT designs, while 23/84 (27.4%) were RCT-only systematic reviews. Seventy-nine different entries were identified for health outcomes, clustered into 10 macro-categories, each reporting a statistically significant association with exposure to the MedDiet. Adherence to MedDiet was found to strongly benefit age-related chronic diseases (21.5%), neurological disorders (19%), and obesity-related metabolic features (12.65), followed by CVDs (11.4%), cancer (10.1%), diabetes (7.5%), liver health (6.3%), inflammation (5%), mortality (5%), and renal health (1.2%). The quality of the studies was moderate to high.\nConclusion: In the context of a \"Planeterranean\" framework and perspective that can be adopted in any European region and worldwide, MedDiet represents a healthy and sustainable lifestyle model, able to prevent several diseases and reduce premature mortality. In addition, the availability of a FOP, such as Med-Index, might foster more conscious food choices among consumers, paying attention both to human and planetary health.",

    "abstract": "Background/objectives: With the increasing life expectancy and, as a result, the aging of the global population, there has been a rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions, which can significantly impact individuals' health-related quality of life, a multidimensional concept that comprises an individual's physical, mental, and social wellbeing. While a balanced, nutrient-dense diet, such as Mediterranean diet, is widely recognized for its role in chronic disease prevention, particularly in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, its potential benefits extend beyond these well-known effects, showing promise in improving physical and mental wellbeing, and promoting health-related quality of life.\nMethods: A systematic search of the scientific literature in electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline) was performed to identify potentially eligible studies reporting on the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and health-related quality of life, published up to December 2024.\nResults: A total of 28 studies were included in this systematic review, comprising 13 studies conducted among the general population and 15 studies involving various types of patients. Overall, most studies showed a significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and HRQoL, with the most significant results retrieved for physical domains of quality of life, suggesting that diet seems to play a relevant role in both the general population and people affected by chronic conditions with an inflammatory basis.\nConclusions: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet provides significant benefits in preventing and managing various chronic diseases commonly associated with aging populations. Furthermore, it enhances the overall health and quality of life of aging individuals, ultimately supporting more effective and less invasive treatment approaches for chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease. Weight reductions of ⩾10% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one stage. However, modest weight loss (>5%) can also produce important benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of weight loss diet, micro- and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications through established behavioural change models and techniques for long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications. Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake, especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40% of the calories vs. 50-60% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acid intake (40% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30% in a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with cardio-metabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A 'triple hit behavioural phenotype' of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain.",

    "title": "Is Extra Virgin Olive Oil the Critical Ingredient Driving the Health Benefits of a Mediterranean Diet? A Narrative Review",
    "abstract": "Most chronic diseases are preventable with a healthy diet, although there is debate about the optimal dietary approach. Increasingly more countries are focusing on food-based guidelines rather than the traditional nutrient-based approach. Although there is good agreement on plant foods, controversy remains about the types and amounts of fats and oils. This narrative review aims to systematically summarize and evaluate the latest evidence on the protective effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on disease risk factors. A systematic search of the relevant literature using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases was conducted for the years 2000 through December 2022. A narrative synthesis was then undertaken. Of 281 retrieved articles, 34 articles fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included. Compared with other dietary fats and low-fat diets, EVOO is superior in the management of clinical biomarkers including lowering blood pressure and LDL-c, increasing protective HDL-c, improving glycemic control, and weight management. The protective effects of EVOO are likely due to its polyphenol content rather than the monounsaturated fat content. It is therefore important to promote the regular use of EVOO in the context of healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet for maximal health benefit.",

    "abstract": "Background: Diabesity, the intersection of obesity and diabetes, presents a global health crisis with profound implications. Addressing diabesity requires multifaceted strategies, with diet playing a pivotal role. Over the last 15 years, clinical studies have intensified their exploration of various dietary approaches in diabesity management. This literature review aims to synthesize findings from clinical studies conducted in the last 15 years, shedding light on the efficacy, mechanisms, and nuances of different diet types in diabesity management with special focus on the Mediterranean diet (MD).\nMethods: Thorough research of academic databases yielded a collection of relevant clinical studies. These studies encompassed a range of dietary strategies, including the MD, low-carbohydrate diets, plant-based diets, high-protein diets, low-fat regimens, and intermittent fasting. Key findings, methodologies, and outcomes were thoroughly extracted and analyzed.\nResults: The last 15 years have witnessed considerable improvements in recognizing the role of human nutritional habits in diabesity management. The MD appears to be the most well-recognized diet, exerting favorable effects against both obesity and diabetes. Low-carbohydrate diets were found to enhance glycemic regulation and decrease insulin resistance. Plant-based diets demonstrated potential benefits in weight management and cardiometabolic health. High-protein, low-fat dietary models exhibited positive effects on satiety and body weight decline. Intermittent fasting regimens also exerted metabolic improvements and body weight decline. Personalization emerged as a crucial factor in dietary recommendations.\nConclusions: Clinical studies from the last 15 years underscore the intricate relationship between diet types and diabesity management. The above results contribute to an increasing body of evidence, emphasizing the need for tailored dietary approaches and especially the MD. Healthcare providers can utilize this knowledge to offer personalized dietary recommendations for individuals with diabesity, potentially curbing the rise of these twin epidemics and improving the well-being of affected populations.",

    "abstract": "As the incidence of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) increases, preventive approaches become more crucial. In this review, calorie restriction (CR) effects on human beings were evaluated, comparing the benefits and risks of different CR diets: classic CR vs. ketosis-inducing diets, including intermittent fasting (IF), classic ketogenic diet (CKD), fasting mimicking diet (FMD), very-low-calorie ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet (SKMD). Special emphasis on insulin resistance (IR) was placed, as it mediates metabolic syndrome (MS), a known risk factor for CNCD, and is predictive of MS diagnosis. CR is the most robust intervention known to increase lifespan and health span, with high evidence and known biochemical mechanisms. CR improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, boosts exercise insulin sensitivity response, and there may be benefits of implementing moderate CR on healthy young and middle-aged individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence to support long-term CR. CKD is effective for weight and MS management, and may have additional benefits such as prevention of muscle loss and appetite control. SKMD has extreme significance benefits for all the metabolic parameters studied. Studies show inconsistent benefits of IF compared to classic CR. More studies are required to study biochemical parameters, reinforce evidence, identify risks, and seek effective and safe nutritional CR approaches.",

    "abstract": "Female breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer. The long-term survival rates for this disease have increased; however, the unique demand for high-quality healthcare to improve breast-cancer survivorship are commonly unmet. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is associated with reduced breast-cancer risk and various health-related benefits in the general population, but its effect on breast-cancer survivors remains uncertain. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess current evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (cohort, cross-sectional and case-control) regarding the effect of the MD on survival, quality of life (QoL) and health-related outcomes in female breast-cancer survivors. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane library were searched for studies published before and including April 2022. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and completed the data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment. Eleven studies (fifteen reports) were included, including two RCTs, four cohort and five cross-sectional studies. The meta-analysis of the cohort studies showed strong evidence of an inverse association between high adherence to the MD and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.93, I2: 0%, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) = low certainty of evidence) and non-breast-cancer mortality (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.90, I2: 0%, GRADE = very low certainty of evidence). The associations between high adherence to the MD and QoL and health-related parameters were not consistent. These findings highlight the potential of adherence to the MD to reduce the risk of mortality. Future research with better study designs, as well as more consistent measurements of QoL and MD adherence, taking into account changes in MD adherence over time and population subgroups, is needed to provide more robust evidence on the survival, QoL and health-related outcomes in BC survivors.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) in the management of diabetes have been reported, but the contribution of polyphenol-rich citrus fruit has not been studied widely. Here, we report the sub-study findings of a previously conducted MedDiet intervention clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), where we aimed to measure the diet intervention effects on plasma citrus bioflavonoids levels and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. We analysed plasma samples from 19 (of original 27) participants with T2DM who were randomly assigned to consume the MedDiet intervention or their usual diet for 12 weeks and then crossed over to the alternate diet. Compared with baseline, MedDiet significantly increased levels of the citrus bioflavonoids naringin, hesperitin and hesperidin (by 60%, 58% and 39%, respectively, p < 0.05) and reduced plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (by 49%, p = 0.016). Oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) decreased by 32.4% (p = 0.128). Usual diet did not induce these beneficial changes. The reduced inflammatory profile of T2DM participants may, in part, be attributed to the anti-inflammatory actions of citrus bioflavonoids. Together with indications of improved oxidative stress, these findings add to the scientific evidence base for beneficial consumption of citrus fruit in the MedDiet pattern.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to update available knowledge on the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) and cognitive decline, risk of dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and to analyse the reasons for some inconsistent results across studies. The traditional MeDi has been recognised by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This dietary pattern is characterised by a high consumption of plant foods (i.e. vegetables, fruits, legumes and cereals), a high intake of olive oil as the main source of fat, a moderate intake of fish, low-to-moderate intake of dairy products and low consumption of meat and poultry, with wine consumed in low-to-moderate amounts during meals. Beyond the well-known association between higher adherence to the MeDi and lower risk of mortality, in particular from CVD and cancer, new data from large epidemiological studies suggest a relationship between MeDi adherence and cognitive decline or risk of dementia. However, some inconsistent results have been found as well, even in Mediterranean countries. In this review, we analyse the reasons likely to explain these discrepancies, and propose that most of these differences are due to variations in the methodology used to assess MeDi adherence. We also discuss the possibility of residual confounding by lifestyle, that is, greater adherents to the MeDi also have a healthier lifestyle in general, which can favourably affect cognition. In conclusion, large-scale studies in various populations with common methodology are required before considering the MeDi as an optimal dietary strategy to prevent cognitive decline or dementia.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet has gained significant attention for its potential health benefits on diverse pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and inflammation. Numerous observational studies have suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, may have protective effects against OA. The abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds and omega-3 fatty acids, among the Mediterranean diet components is believed to contribute to its beneficial effects on OA. Research investigating the association between the Mediterranean diet and OA has shown promising results. Several observational studies have reported that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing OA and with lower severity of OA symptoms. Additionally, intervention studies have demonstrated improvements in pain, function, and quality of life among OA patients following a Mediterranean diet intervention. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against OA, including its ability to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degradation. However, further well-designed randomized controlled trials and mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and establish causality. In conclusion, the Mediterranean diet appears to be a promising dietary approach for the prevention and management of OA. Its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds may exert protective effects against OA development and progression, although more research is warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently seek dietary advice, but few evidence-based options exist. Major societal guidelines recommend traditional dietary advice (TDA) as first-line therapy, with the cumbersome and resource-intensive low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet reserved as second-line therapy. Recent pilot data suggest that the Mediterranean diet (MD), renowned for its general health benefits, improves IBS symptoms, but whether it can be considered another first-line dietary option is unknown.\nObjective: To determine if the MD is noninferior to TDA in managing IBS symptoms.\nDesign: Randomized noninferiority clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05985018).\nSetting: Online virtual platform.\nParticipants: 139 persons with IBS from across the United Kingdom.\nIntervention: 6 weeks of the MD (n = 68) or TDA (n = 71).\nMeasurements: Primary end point was the proportion achieving clinical response, defined as 50-point or greater reduction in IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). Secondary outcomes included changes in IBS-SSS scores, psychological health, somatic symptom reporting, quality of life, diet satisfaction, and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS).\nResults: Baseline characteristics (mean age, 40.4 years [range, 19 to 65 years]; 80% women) and IBS-SSS (mean, 309 [SD, 90]) were similar between groups. On modified intention-to-treat analysis, the primary end point was met by 62% (95% CI, 50% to 73%) following a MD versus 42% (CI, 31% to 55%) following TDA. The difference in clinical response favored the MD (difference, 20 percentage points [CI, 4 to 36 percentage points]; P = 0.017), demonstrating noninferiority and superiority. There was a greater reduction in the mean IBS-SSS after a MD than TDA (-101.2 vs. -64.5; Δ-36.7 [CI,-70.5 to -2.8]; P = 0.034). No statistically significant differences were seen between the groups with regard to changes in mood, somatic symptoms, quality of life, or diet satisfaction. The MEDAS significantly increased after a MD compared with TDA (P < 0.001).\nLimitation: No long-term data.\nConclusion: The MD showed noninferiority and superiority to TDA in managing IBS symptoms. It represents a viable first-line dietary intervention for IBS.\nPrimary funding source: None.",

One of the most common forms of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent research has highlighted diet as a potential modifiable risk factor for AD. Decades of research have explored the role of dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its components, in neuroprotection and cognitive health. Systematic review examines studies investigating the impact of the Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean-like diets, the Nordic Diet (ND), dietary intake patterns, and specific components such as extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil on cognitive function, disease onset, and progression in AD and dementia.\nMethods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and the Social Science Research Network was conducted independently by two reviewers using predefined search terms. The search period included studies from 2006 to 2024. Eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed, yielding 88 studies: 85 focused on the MD and its relationship to AD and dementia, while only 3 investigated the ND.\nResults: The findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean and Nordic diets is generally associated with improved cognitive function and delayed cognitive decline and that adherence to both these diets can improve cognitive function. Some studies identified that higher legume consumption decreased dementia incidence, while fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, and eggs lowered dementia prevalence. Most studies demonstrated that high MD or ND adherence was associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of poor cognition in comparison to individuals with lower MD or ND adherence. However, some studies reported no significant benefits of the MD on cognitive outcomes, while two studies indicated that higher red meat consumption was linked to better cognitive function.\nConclusion: Despite promising trends, the evidence remains varying across studies, underscoring the need for further research to establish definitive associations between diet and cognitive function. These findings highlight the essential role of dietary interventions in the prevention and management of dementia and AD, therefore offering critical insights into the underlying mechanisms by which the diet may impact brain health.",

However, its impact on the fecal metabolome remains poorly understood.\nObjectives: Our goal was to investigate the weight-loss effects of a 1-y lifestyle intervention based on an energy-reduced MedDiet coupled with physical activity (intervention group), compared with an ad libitum MedDiet (control group), on fecal metabolites, fecal microbiota, and their potential association with cardiovascular disease risk factors.\nMethods: A total of 400 participants (200 from each study group), aged 55-75 y, and at high cardiovascular disease risk, were included. Dietary and lifestyle information, anthropometric measurements, blood biochemical parameters, and stool samples were collected at baseline and after 1 y of follow-up. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to profile endogenous fecal metabolites, and 16S amplicon sequencing was employed to profile the fecal microbiota.\nResults: Compared with the control group, the intervention group exhibited greater weight loss and improvement in various cardiovascular disease risk factors. We identified intervention effects on 4 stool metabolites and subnetworks primarily composed of bile acids, ceramides, and sphingosines, fatty acids, carnitines, nucleotides, and metabolites of purine and the Krebs cycle. Some of these were associated with changes in several cardiovascular disease risk factors. In addition, we observed a reduction in the abundance of the genera Eubacterium hallii group and Dorea, and an increase in alpha diversity in the intervention group after 1 y of follow-up. Changes in the intervention-related microbiota profiles were also associated with alterations in different fecal metabolite subnetworks and some cardiovascular disease risk factors.\nConclusions: An intervention based on an energy-reduced MedDiet and physical activity promotion, compared with an ad libitum MedDiet, was associated with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, potentially through modulation of the fecal microbiota and metabolome.

These recent studies included 2 health outcomes not previously investigated (ie, mild cognitive impairment and stroke). The meta-analysis for all studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94).

Since then, our understanding of the role of the MedDiet and its role in reducing risk of chronic diseases has grown substantially.\nObjectives: This article aims to provide a narrative review of the historical context of the MedDiet and its environmental impact, summarize health-related evidence from the past 3 decades, and explore its practical applications and cultural adaptations.\nMethods: Relevant studies were identified through searches of PubMed and other major databases. We prioritzed publications from the past 3 decades, while also including influential earlier studies where appropriate. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively to summarize key findings and identify gaps for future research.\nResults: A large body of evidence from prospective cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, and mechanistic studies consistently supports the benefits of the MedDiet for the prevention of chronic diseases, particularly cardiometabolic diseases and the improvement of healthy aging. Growing evidence demonstrates that the MedDiet promotes favorable changes in circulating metabolites and gut microbiome composition, providing novel insights into biological mechanisms underlying its health benefits and informing the development of precision nutrition strategies. The MedDiet aligns with the principles of the planetary health diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission, which aims to promote both human health and environmental sustainability. The development of the MedDiet pyramid 30 y ago inspired the creation of the Asian, African, and Latin-American heritage diet pyramids.\nConclusions: Over the past 3 decades, substantial evidence has accumulated to strongly support the benefits of the MedDiet in preventing chronic diseases and promoting healthy aging. Despite robust evidence, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and adaptability of the MedDiet across diverse populations, cultural settings, and food environments.",

    "abstract": "Abundant and growing evidence has accrued to demonstrate that the traditional Mediterranean diet is likely to be the ideal dietary pattern for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A landmark randomized trial (PREDIMED) together with many well-conducted long-term observational prospective cohort studies support this causal effect.A new, large British cohort study by Tong et al. assessing the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular disease was recently published in BMC Medicine. Using a superb methodology, they followed-up 23,902 participants for 12.2 years on average and observed several thousand incident cases.The results of this cohort study showed a significant beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular events. These findings support the transferability of this dietary pattern beyond the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The authors provided measures of population impact in cardiovascular prevention and estimated that 19,375 cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented each year in the UK by promoting the Mediterranean Diet.Please see related article: http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-016-0677-4 .",

    "title": "Benefits of the Mediterranean diet: Epidemiological and molecular aspects",
    "abstract": "More than 50 years after the Seven Countries Study, a large number of epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MD) and health, through observational, case-control, some longitudinal and a few experimental studies. The overall results show strong evidence suggesting a protective effect of the MD mainly on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and certain types of cancer. The beneficial effects have been attributed to the types of food consumed, total dietary pattern, components in the food, cooking techniques, eating behaviors and lifestyle behaviors, among others. The aim of this article is to review and summarize the knowledge derived from the literature focusing on the benefits of the MD on health, including those that have been extensively investigated (CVD, cancer) along with more recent issues such as mental health, immunity, quality of life, etc. The review begins with a brief description of the MD and its components. Then we present a review of studies evaluating metabolic biomarkers and genotypes in relation to the MD. Other sections are dedicated to observation and intervention studies for various pathologies. Finally, some insights into the relationship between the MD and sustainability are explored. In conclusion, the research undertaken on metabolomics approaches has identified potential markers for certain MD components and patterns, but more investigation is needed to obtain valid measures. Further evaluation of gene-MD interactions are also required to better understand the mechanisms by which the MD diet exerts its beneficial effects on health. Observation and intervention studies, particularly PREDIMED, have provided invaluable data on the benefits of the MD for a wide range of chronic diseases. However further research is needed to explore the effects of other lifestyle components associated with Mediterranean populations, its environmental impact, as well as the MD extrapolation to non-Mediterranean contexts.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based healthy diet similar to the vegetarian and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets. Unlike vegetarian and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, the Mediterranean diet encourages a lifestyle associated with physical activity, and social connections. In addition, the Mediterranean diet is not based on restriction of nutrients but does limit intake of processed foods. Prospective studies have confirmed that the Mediterranean diet confers primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population. The benefits of the Mediterranean diet lifestyle include reducing the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and lowers blood pressure. In adults with CKD, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of CKD progression and its complications such as hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis, and reduces production of uremic toxins and inflammatory mediators when compared to omnivore dietary patterns. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to confirm the cardiovascular disease prevention with the Mediterranean diet in adults with CKD. Medical nutrition therapy remains a cornerstone of CKD management, and the Mediterranean diet could be utilized to slow CKD progression and complications.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of review: The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are clear; virtually everyone can benefit from becoming more physically active. Most international guidelines recommend a goal of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Many agencies have translated these recommendations to indicate that this volume of activity is the minimum required for health benefits. However, recent evidence has challenged this threshold-centered messaging as it may not be evidence-based and may create an unnecessary barrier to those who might benefit greatly from simply becoming more active. This systematic review evaluates recent systematic reviews that have examined the relationship between physical activity and health status.\nRecent findings: Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (based largely on epidemiological studies consisting of large cohorts) have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between physical activity and premature mortality and the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic medical conditions. The relationships between physical activity and health outcomes are generally curvilinear such that marked health benefits are observed with relatively minor volumes of physical activity.\nSummary: These findings challenge current threshold-based messaging related to physical activity and health. They emphasize that clinically relevant health benefits can be accrued by simply becoming more physically active. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/HCO/A42.",

The evidence base was largest for all-cause mortality (50 separate results; 163 415 543 person-years, 811 616 events), and incidence of cardiovascular disease (37 results; 28 884 209 person-years, 74 757 events) and cancer (31 results; 35 500 867 person-years, 185 870 events). In general, higher activity levels were associated with lower risk of all outcomes. Differences in risk were greater between 0 and 8.75 marginal metabolic equivalent of task-hours per week (mMET-hours/week) (equivalent to the recommended 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic physical activity), with smaller marginal differences in risk above this level to 17.5 mMET-hours/week, beyond which additional differences were small and uncertain. Associations were stronger for all-cause (relative risk (RR) at 8.75 mMET-hours/week: 0.69, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.73) and cardiovascular disease (RR at 8.75 mMET-hours/week: 0.71, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77) mortality than for cancer mortality (RR at 8.75 mMET-hours/week: 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89). If all insufficiently active individuals had achieved 8.75 mMET-hours/week, 15.7% (95% CI 13.1 to 18.2) of all premature deaths would have been averted.\nConclusions: Inverse non-linear dose-response associations suggest substantial protection against a range of chronic disease outcomes from small increases in non-occupational physical activity in inactive adults.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide guidance to professionals who counsel and prescribe individualized exercise to apparently healthy adults of all ages. These recommendations also may apply to adults with certain chronic diseases or disabilities, when appropriately evaluated and advised by a health professional. This document supersedes the 1998 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand, \"The Recommended Quantity and Quality of Exercise for Developing and Maintaining Cardiorespiratory and Muscular Fitness, and Flexibility in Healthy Adults.\" The scientific evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of exercise is indisputable, and the benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks in most adults. A program of regular exercise that includes cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercise training beyond activities of daily living to improve and maintain physical fitness and health is essential for most adults. The ACSM recommends that most adults engage in moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥30 min·d on ≥5 d·wk for a total of ≥150 min·wk, vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥20 min·d on ≥3 d·wk (≥75 min·wk), or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise to achieve a total energy expenditure of ≥500-1000 MET·min·wk. On 2-3 d·wk, adults should also perform resistance exercises for each of the major muscle groups, and neuromotor exercise involving balance, agility, and coordination. Crucial to maintaining joint range of movement, completing a series of flexibility exercises for each the major muscle-tendon groups (a total of 60 s per exercise) on ≥2 d·wk is recommended. The exercise program should be modified according to an individual's habitual physical activity, physical function, health status, exercise responses, and stated goals. Adults who are unable or unwilling to meet the exercise targets outlined here still can benefit from engaging in amounts of exercise less than recommended. In addition to exercising regularly, there are health benefits in concurrently reducing total time engaged in sedentary pursuits and also by interspersing frequent, short bouts of standing and physical activity between periods of sedentary activity, even in physically active adults. Behaviorally based exercise interventions, the use of behavior change strategies, supervision by an experienced fitness instructor, and exercise that is pleasant and enjoyable can improve adoption and adherence to prescribed exercise programs. Educating adults about and screening for signs and symptoms of CHD and gradual progression of exercise intensity and volume may reduce the risks of exercise. Consultations with a medical professional and diagnostic exercise testing for CHD are useful when clinically indicated but are not recommended for universal screening to enhance the safety of exercise.",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases are major killers in the modern era. Physical inactivity is a primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases. In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life.",

Exercise prescriptions for older adults should account for the individual's health status and functional capacity. Any amount of exercise is better than being sedentary, even if health status prevents a person from achieving recommended goals. For most health outcomes, more benefits occur with physical activity performed at higher intensity, greater frequency, or longer duration. Guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity and at least two days of muscle-strengthening activities per week. Key components of the prescription include setting achievable activity goals, identifying barriers and providing potential solutions, and providing specific recommendations on the type, frequency, and intensity of activities. Older adults will derive distinct benefits from aerobic exercise, strength or resistance training, flexibility or stretching exercises, and balance training.

However, evidence was largely based on the general population. Here we summarized the latest evidence supporting lifestyle intervention in chronic kidney disease.\nRecent findings: Both observational cohort studies as well as randomized controlled trials have demonstrated health benefits with more physical activity in chronic kidney disease. There are compelling observational data supporting different health and kidney benefits with a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-based foods and low in salt, low in sugar, saturated fat, red meat and ultraprocessed foods, a plant-based diet or Mediterranean diet in chronic kidney disease population. Clinical and epidemiologic studies also showed that higher 24 h urine potassium excretion (as proxy of higher dietary potassium intake) may be associated with lower blood pressure, better kidney outcomes and lower mortality in chronic kidney disease population. Randomized controlled trials also suggested that salt substitutes improved blood pressure control, reduced all-cause death and cardiovascular event risk in the general population compared with regular salt.\nSummary: Accumulating evidence supports the current recommendation of encouraging physical activity and promoting a healthy dietary pattern in chronic kidney disease patients. Whether potassium needs restriction in chronic kidney disease diet requires further review. The safety versus benefits of salt substitutes in patients with moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical, epidemiological and basic research evidence clearly supports the inclusion of regular physical activity as a tool for the prevention of chronic disease and the enhancement of overall health. In children, activities of a moderate intensity may enhance overall health, and assist in preventing chronic disease in at-risk youth. The numerous health benefits of regular exercise are dependent on the type, intensity and volume of activity pursued by the individual. These benefits include reduction of low density lipoproteins while increasing high density lipoprotein; improvement of glucose metabolism in patients with type II diabetes; improved strength, self esteem and body image; and reduction in the occurrence of back injuries. In addition, a progressive, moderate-intensity exercise program will not adversely effect the immune system and may have a beneficial effect on the interleukin-2/natural killer cell system. Furthermore, by decreasing sedentary behaviors and, thus, increasing daily physical activity, individuals may experience many stress-reducing benefits, which may enhance the immune system.\nConclusion: Moderate intensity exercise of a non-structured nature seems to facilitate most of the disease prevention goals and health promoting benefits. With new guidelines promoting a less intense and more time-efficient approach to regular physical activity, it is hoped that an upward trend in the physical activity patterns, and specifically children at risk for chronic disease, will develop in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Non-communicable disease is a leading threat to global health. Physical inactivity is a large contributor to this problem; in fact, the WHO ranks it as the fourth leading risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Canada, at least 4 of 5 adults do not meet the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. Physicians play an important role in the dissemination of physical activity (PA) recommendations to a broad segment of the population, as over 80% of Canadians visit their doctors every year and prefer to get health information directly from them. Unfortunately, most physicians do not regularly assess or prescribe PA as part of routine care, and even when discussed, few provide specific recommendations. PA prescription has the potential to be an important therapeutic agent for all ages in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of chronic disease. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) physicians are particularly well suited for this role and should collaborate with their primary care colleagues for optimal patient care. The purpose of this Canadian Academy and Sport and Exercise Medicine position statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to better equip SEM and primary care physicians to prescribe PA and exercise, specifically for the prevention and management of non-communicable disease. This will be achieved by addressing common questions and perceived barriers in the field.Author note This position statement has been endorsed by the following nine sport medicine societies: Australasian College of Sports and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP), American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), British Association of Sports and Exercise Medicine (BASEM), European College of Sport & Exercise Physicians (ECOSEP), Norsk forening for idrettsmedisin og fysisk aktivite (NIMF), South African Sports Medicine Association (SASMA), Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Sportmedizin/Swiss Society of Sports Medicine (SGSM/SSSM), Sport Doctors Australia (SDrA), Swedish Society of Exercise and Sports Medicine (SFAIM), and CASEM.",

Although general health checks are often expected and advocated by patients, clinicians, insurers, and health systems, others question their value.\nObservations: Randomized trials and observational studies with control groups reported in prior systematic reviews and an updated literature review through March 2021 were included. Among 19 randomized trials (906 to 59 616 participants; follow-up, 1 to 30 years), 5 evaluated a single general health check, 7 evaluated annual health checks, 1 evaluated biannual checks, and 6 evaluated health checks delivered at other frequencies. Twelve of 13 observational studies (240 to 471 415 participants; follow-up, cross-sectional to 5 years) evaluated a single general health check. General health checks were generally not associated with decreased mortality, cardiovascular events, or cardiovascular disease incidence. For example, in the South-East London Screening Study (n = 7229), adults aged 40 to 64 years who were invited to 2 health checks over 2 years, compared with adults not invited to screening, experienced no 8-year mortality benefit (6% vs 5%). General health checks were associated with increased detection of chronic diseases, such as depression and hypertension; moderate improvements in controlling risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol; increased clinical preventive service uptake, such as colorectal and cervical cancer screening; and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and self-rated health. In the Danish Check-In Study (n = 1104), more patients randomized to receive to a single health check, compared with those randomized to receive usual care, received a new antidepressant prescription over 1 year (5% vs 2%; P = .007). In a propensity score-matched analysis (n = 8917), a higher percentage of patients who attended a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, compared with those who did not, underwent colorectal cancer screening (69% vs 60%; P < .01). General health checks were sometimes associated with modest improvements in health behaviors such as physical activity and diet. In the OXCHECK trial (n = 4121), fewer patients randomized to receive annual health checks, compared with those not randomized to receive health checks, exercised less than once per month (68% vs 71%; difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 0.5%-6.1%]). Potential adverse effects in individual studies included an increased risk of stroke and increased mortality attributed to increased completion of advance directives.\nConclusions and relevance: General health checks were not associated with reduced mortality or cardiovascular events, but were associated with increased chronic disease recognition and treatment, risk factor control, preventive service uptake, and improved patient-reported outcomes. Primary care teams may reasonably offer general health checks, especially for groups at high risk of overdue preventive services, uncontrolled risk factors, low self-rated health, or poor connection or inadequate access to primary care.",

Pulmonary rehabilitation is a comprehensive therapeutic approach for patients with advanced chronic lung diseases which leads to a decline of dyspnea, an increase of exercise capacity and an increase of quality of life. Further effects are a reduction of frequency of hospitalisations and an increase of physical activity, if a self management education program is integrated. Pulmonary rehabilitation incorporates an individualised training program with focus on endurance, strength and mobility, further a disease specific education with the goal to improve self efficacy and self management of the patients, specially with the goal to improve their daily physical activity. Due to the good evidence of pulmonary rehabilitation, the accredited programs are accepted and paid by the swiss insurances.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite advancement in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), induction and maintenance of remission remain challenging to achieve in many patients and a significant proportion of patients with IBD experience mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and fatigue, which impair their quality of life (QoL). We aim to describe the available evidence regarding the effects of physical activity (PA) on the onset of IBD, its disease course, and important patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as QoL, fatigue, and mental health.\nMethods: A literature search was performed using electronic databases to identify original articles that assessed the effects of PA in patients with IBD using PROMs.\nResults: Prospective cohort and case-control studies demonstrate inverse relationships between PA and new-onset IBD in Crohn's disease but not in ulcerative colitis; however, they have small sample sizes and caution must be taken in considering associations versus causation. Small randomized controlled trials suggest promise for PA and beneficial outcomes, such as maintenance of clinical remission and improvement in QoL, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. However, these studies were small and underpowered, and limited by outcome measurements and durations of follow-up.\nConclusions: Physicians may consider discussing PA interventions with their patients on an individual basis, especially if they report impaired QoL, fatigue, depression, or anxiety, until disease-specific guidelines are available. Including PA as part of a primary prevention strategy in high-risk patients could be considered.",

    "abstract": "The main recommendations from public health entities include healthy diets and physical activity as the main lifestyle factors impacting the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer, and even neurological diseases. Randomized clinical trials have been designed to demonstrate those lifestyle modifications can change the pattern of chronic diseases development and progression. Among these, nutrition is one of the most impacting factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in different randomized clinical trials, and most of them showed a favorable impact of nutrition modification on the participant's health. Nevertheless, study designs were considerably different, and future studies are needed to support nutrition modifications further. The choice of a healthy considered diet, like the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases, cardiovascular risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense, processed foods contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. Besides these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be personalized according to the availability of foods, geographic localizations, and the healthy status of the patient.",

    "abstract": "Chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (CSSI) is a pathogenic event and a common risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases like atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, cancer, and obstructive lung disease. On the other hand, regular physical activity has been found to reduce this risk. Many studies of different design were conducted to assess the association between inflammatory mediators as markers of CSSI and regular physical activity. The aim of this review was to present the current level of evidence and understanding of potential mechanisms by which physical activity reduces inflammatory mediators involved in CSSI and the types of physical activity required for the expected effect. We have found that observational studies consistently report a positive association between regular physical activity and lower CSSI, but the design of these studies does not allow to infer a causal relationship. Interventional studies, in contrast, were not consistent about the causal relationship between regular physical activity and lower CSSI. The problem in interpreting these results lies in significant differences between these interventional studies in their design, sample size, study population, and intervention itself (intensity and extent, follow up, weight loss). We can conclude that the scientific community has to invest a significant effort into high-quality interventional trials focused on finding the type, intensity, and extent of physical activity that would produce the most favourable effect on CSSI.",

Low level of physical activity (i.e. inactivity) is recognized as the second preventable common risk factor of chronic diseases after the tobacco use. Nonlinear dose-effect relationships are found between the volume and intensity of physical activity, and the global mortality and incidence of chronic diseases. A sedentary behavior, characterized by prolonged periods of very low energy expenditure, is also related to the global mortality and the incidence of chronic diseases. The deleterious effects of sedentary behavior are especially marked beyond seven hours a day sitting, or three hours a day in watching the television. All the results of recent survey demonstrate that in order to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases, both physical activity recommendations and decrease in sedentary time are recommended, whatever the age of the population.",

Its function is important in all life cycles and helps to keep the functional capabilities and independence even with aging.\nResults: While inadequate physical activity (due to a sedentary lifestyle) is currently the fourth leading cause of mortality in developed countries, being one of the main public health issues, strong scientific evidences show that a regular and sufficient dose of physical activity reduces by about 30% the risk of premature death, cardiovascular disease and stroke, type II diabetes, colon and breast cancer, depression.\nConclusions: Several guidelines and recommendations define the type, intensity, frequency and duration of physical activity, and many lifestyle preventative interventions prove its effectiveness and sustainability. Although so far a minority of the population actually adheres to the recommendations, the epidemiological strenght of lifestyle-oriented programs is considerable: quitting sedentariness, even low doses of physical activity are protective for health and reduce by about 22 % the risk of premature death. Physical activity is also an important therapeutic tool for patients with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes II, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; an appropriate dosage reduces the risk of recurrence and disease progression, improves the control of clinical parameters and increases the patient's quality of life.",

Using net favorable percentages and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics' intervention ladder framework to guide analysis, the authors examined support for evidence-based healthy public policies to increase physical activity levels.\nResults: Less intrusive policy options (ie, policies that are not always the most impactful) tended to have higher levels of support than policies that eliminated choice. However, there was support for certain types of policies affecting influential determinants of physical activity such as the built environment (ie, provided they enabled rather than restricted choice) and school settings (ie, focusing on children and youth). Overall, the general public indicated stronger levels of support for more physical activity policy options than policy influencers.\nConclusions: The authors' findings may be useful for health advocates in identifying support for evidence-based healthy public policies affecting more influential determinants of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Background: The evidence that higher levels of physical activity and/or lower levels of physical inactivity are associated with beneficial health-related outcomes stems mainly from observational studies. Findings from these studies often differ from randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews currently demonstrate mixed results, due partly to heterogeneity in physical activity interventions, methodologies used and populations studied. As a result, translation into clinical practice has been difficult. It is therefore essential that an overview is carried out to compare and contrast systematic reviews, and to identify those physical activity interventions that are the most effective in preventing and/or treating major chronic disease. This protocol has been registered on PROSPERO 2013: CRD42013003523.\nMethods: We will carry out an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews. We will search the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that have a primary focus on disease-related outcomes. We will restrict reviews to those in selected major chronic diseases. Two authors will independently screen search outputs, select studies, extract data and assess the quality of included reviews using the assessment of multiple systematic reviews tool; all discrepancies will be resolved by discussing and reaching a consensus, or by arbitration with a third author. The data extraction form will summarise key information from each review, including details of the population(s) (for example, disease condition), the context (for example, prevention, treatment or management), the participants, the intervention(s), the comparison(s) and the outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest are the prevention of chronic disease and/or improved outcomes, in the treatment or management of chronic disease. These outcomes will be summarised and presented for individual chronic diseases (for example, any change in blood pressure in hypertension or glucose control in diabetes). Secondary outcomes of interest are to describe the structure and delivery of physical activity interventions across chronic disease conditions and adverse events associated with physical activity.\nDiscussion: We anticipate that our results could inform researchers, guideline groups and policymakers of the most efficacious physical activity interventions in preventing and/or managing major chronic disease.",

    "abstract": "Aims: Physical activity has a protective effect against mortality and cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Nonetheless, how different levels of physical activity affect the health benefits in CKD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the dose-response effects of physical activity on mortality and major cardiorenal events in CKD.\nMethods and results: We evaluated a longitudinal cohort of 4508 Taiwanese CKD patients between 2004 and 2017. Physical activity was assessed by the NHANES questionnaire and quantified in metabolic equivalent-hours per week (MET-hour/week). Patients were categorized into highly active (≥7.5 MET-h/week), low-active (0.1 to <7.5 MET-h/week), or inactive (0 MET-h/week) groups. Cox regression and restricted cubic spline models were utilized to explore the association between physical activity and the risks of study outcomes, including all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and hospitalized heart failure). During a median follow-up of 686 days, 739 death, 1059 ESRD, and 521 MACE events occurred. Highly active group had the lowest chance of all study outcomes, followed by low-active and inactive groups (P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression showed that only highly active group was independently associated with lower risks for all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.74], ESRD (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96), and MACE (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.76) compared to the inactive group. The risks of MACE did not further decrease once physical activity surpassed 15 MET-h/week, indicating a U-shaped association. The results were consistent in the subgroup and sensitivity analyses.\nConclusion: Physical activity of 7.5 to <15 MET-h/week is associated with lower risks of adverse cardiorenal outcomes and should be integrated into the care of CKD.",

The primary outcomes were balance (Berg Balance Scale, 0-56 points) and mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery, 0-12 points) at 3 months. The secondary outcomes were 10 m comfortable walking speed, physical activity levels, health-related quality of life, depression and fall-related self-efficacy.\nResults: At 3 months, the IG exhibited significant improvements in balance (MD 2.5 versus 0 points; effect size [ES], 0.72; p < 0.01) and comfortable walking speed (MD 0.04 versus -0.05 m/s; ES, 0.68; p = 0.01) relative to the CG. A faster walking speed persisted at 6 months. No differences were found for the other outcomes.\nConclusions: In chronic stroke patients, 3 months of PRB exercises and motivational discussions induced improvements in balance at 3 months and in walking speed at 3 and 6 months. Implications for Rehabilitation A progressive resistance and balance exercise program supported by motivational group discussions and one home-based exercise appears to be an effective means of improving the short-term balance and the walking speed in individuals with chronic stroke. People with poor balance and motor function discontinued the study more often and may require additional support. There is a need for powerful and cost-effective strategies that target changes in behavior to obtain long-term changes in physical function after exercising.",

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the translational potential of physical activity-based balance interventions for older adults with common chronic conditions guided by the Reach, Effectiveness/Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Databases were searched (2011-2021) to identify studies with physical activity-based fall prevention interventions for older adults with chronic conditions. Data were collected using the RE-AIM coding guide and Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for evidence quality. The search yielded 122 articles, of which 14 distinct studies were included. The most reported RE-AIM dimensions across the studies were Reach (46.2%) and Implementation (40.5%), with Effectiveness/Efficacy (29.4%), Adoption (2.0%), and Maintenance (5.4%) being the least reported. Studies were largely conducted in controlled research environments with minimal staff involvement and without long-term follow-up periods. While studies found that physical activity-based programs were effective in improving balance, information on representativeness and adoption/maintenance of programs was lacking. Studies included sufficient details about the intervention (content, dosage, progression). External validity RE-AIM indicators were reported less frequently than internal validity indicators. The studies were of moderate quality overall. Studies often lacked information on indicators critical for understanding how to implement these programs. This review signals the need to investigate the translation of these interventions from controlled research settings to clinical settings to improve the public impact of fall prevention for this population.",

Obesity is defined by a high BMI. The web-based wellness platform employed in this study is My Viva Plan (MVP)®, which holistically integrates nutrition, physical activity, and mindfulness programs. Over 16 weeks, the experimental group uses the web-based wellness platform daily and engages in weekly online support group sessions. The active control group exclusively uses the web-based wellness platform daily. Assessments are conducted at baseline and weeks 8 and 16. The primary outcome is between-group difference in weight loss (kg) at week 16, and secondary outcomes are BMI, percent weight change, proportion of participants achieving 5% or more weight loss, dietary intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sleep, and stress across the study. A web-based wellness platform may be a scalable approach to promote behavioural changes that positively impact health.

Leisure-time physical activity, including type and intensity of activity, was measured by questionnaire in 1986. A National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index pain score was calculated on the basis of the responses on the 2008 questionnaire. Participants with pain scores ≥8 were considered CP/CPPS cases (n = 689).\nResults: Higher leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risk of CP/CPPS.

Moreover, activity has beneficial effects on an individual's health and well-being. Despite the benefits of regular physical activity, the percentage of physically inactive adults in the world is high. Environmental and policy approaches aimed to increase physical activity require continual stress of the epidemiological evidence from studies investigating disease mechanisms as well as controlled clinical trials.\nPurpose: To update the evidence that physical activity/exercise is important for reducing the chronic diseases (cardiovascular and heart, diabetes, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, and fall-related injuries, depression and emotional stress) and for mechanisms that may operate in the relation between physical activity and a disease risk.\nMethods: Research studies published from 2004 through to March 2007 were identified through a review of the literature available on the NLM PubMed, Medline, Current Contents, and Elsevier-Science Direct databases.\nResults: Recent evidence on physical activity/exercise and reduction of chronic major diseases incidence and rehabilitation of patients replicates previous findings. The strongest evidence exists for colon cancer, breast cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. The maximal magnitudes of the risk reduction reported were: 75% for breast cancer, 49% for cardiovascular and heart diseases, 35% for diabetes, 22% for colorectal cancer. Increased physical activity also prevented the weight gain associated with aging at least 2-times greater in individuals who were more active compared with those who were inactive. Limited new findings has been reported for the beneficial role of physical activity in fall-related injures, depression and emotional distress.\nConclusion: Recent evidence confirms previous findings that engaging in moderate physical activity is very important for the primary prevention of chronic diseases, decreasing all causes of mortality and that exercise is one of the determinants for physical and psychological well-being. The current evidence provides further support that physical activity can suppress concentrations of 17 alpha-estradiol in women.",

On average, vigorously active men and women lived 6.3 years longer in good health and 2.9 years longer without chronic diseases between ages 50 and 75 compared to inactive individuals. The difference in years in good health between vigorously active and inactive individuals was the largest in individuals with low occupation status (6.7 years).\nConclusion: higher levels of physical activity increase healthy and chronic disease-free years similarly in men and women, but more among persons with low than with high occupational status.",

    "title": "Association Between Physical Activity and Odds of Chronic Conditions Among Workers in Spain",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Prevention of chronic conditions is a major public health challenge, and achieving minimum recommended levels of physical activity aids in reaching this objective. The aim of our study was to investigate whether levels of physical activity were associated with the prevalence of common chronic conditions among the Spanish workforce.\nMethods: We retrieved data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 (N = 9,695) in which the mean age of participants was 44.4 (standard deviation, 10.4 y), and 47.4% were women. Workers self-reported a set of 6 chronic conditions (ie, chronic low-back pain, chronic neck pain, diabetes, hypertension, depression, and anxiety), and we used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form to estimate physical activity. We performed multivariable logistic regression adjusted for possible confounders to assess associations between physical activity and chronic conditions.\nResults: The final adjusted model showed that performing less than 600 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week of physical activity was associated with significantly increased odds for chronic conditions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.30). Of the sex and age subgroups analyzed, this association was significant in men aged 17 to 44 (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.46). Among chronic conditions, low-back pain and anxiety were associated with low levels of physical activity, whereas covariates such as body mass index, smoking habits, education level, and occupational class had an important influence on the association between physical activity and chronic conditions.\nConclusion: Results suggest that achieving sufficient physical activity could reduce chronic conditions among Spanish workers.",

    "abstract": "Background: There are no nationally representative population-based studies investigating the relationship between physical activity, chronic conditions and multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic conditions) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and studies on a multi-national level are lacking. This is an important research gap, given the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases associated with lifestyle changes in these countries. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and low physical activity (PA) among community-dwelling adults in 46 LMICs, and explore the mediators of these relationships.\nMethods: World Health Survey data included 228,024 adults aged ≥18 years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Nine chronic physical conditions (chronic back pain, angina, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment and edentulism) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the association between chronic conditions or multimorbidity and low PA.\nResults: Overall, in the multivariable analysis, arthritis (OR = 1.12), asthma (1.19), diabetes (OR = 1.33), edentulism (OR = 1.46), hearing problems (OR = 1.90), tuberculosis (OR = 1.24), visual impairment (OR = 2.29), multimorbidity (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.21-1.42) were significantly associated with low PA. More significant associations were observed in individuals aged ≥50 years. In older adults, depression mediated between 5.1% (visual impairment) to 23.5% (angina) of the association between a chronic condition and low PA. Mobility difficulties explained more than 25% of the association for seven of the eight chronic conditions. Pain was a strong mediator for angina (65.9%) and arthritis (64.9%), while sleep problems mediated up to 43.7% (angina) of the association.\nConclusions: In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and multimorbidity are significantly less physically active (especially older adults). Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA in the management of chronic diseases in LMICs is urgently needed. Targeted promotion of physical activity to populations in LMICs experiencing chronic conditions may ameliorate associated depression, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves important barriers for initiating or adopting an active lifestyle.",

Demographic data, lifestyle factors and clinical characteristics were analyzed for an association with the occurrence of chronic kidney disease. Applicable analysis weights, Stata 11.0, were applied to adjust the design variables for clustering and stratification.\nResults: During the two year study period, the univariate Cox proportional hazards model showed significant associations of age, physical activity, and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) with chronic kidney disease. Physical activity had a beneficial effect in diabetic subjects with chronic kidney disease (HR: 0.31, p<0.01). Older age and a CCI greater than 2 were both harmful in diabetic subjects with chronic kidney disease (1.06 and 3.44, respectively). The results of a multivariate Cox proportional hazards evaluation model were similar to those of a univariate evaluation model, except that CCI was not significantly different. Moreover, medications for hypertension of diabetic subjects created an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (HR: 5.85 and 3.74, respectively), indicating that the presence of hypertension is a strong risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease.\nConclusion: In this study, physical activity was not only a healthful lifestyle factor but also a treatment to decrease incidence of chronic kidney disease in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Although regular physical activity is an effective secondary prevention strategy for patients with a chronic disease, it is unclear whether patients change their daily physical activity after being diagnosed. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) describe changes in levels of physical activity in middle-aged women before and after diagnosis with a chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, asthma, breast cancer, arthritis, depression); and to (2) examine whether diagnosis with a chronic disease affects levels of physical activity in these women.\nMethods: Data from 5 surveys (1998-2010) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) were used. Participants (N=4840, born 1946-1951) completed surveys every three years, with questions about diseases and leisure time physical activity. The main outcome measure was physical activity, categorized as: nil/sedentary, low active, moderately active, highly active.\nResults: At each survey approximately half the middle-aged women did not meet the recommended level of physical activity. Between consecutive surveys, 41%-46% of the women did not change, 24%-30% decreased, and 24%-31% increased their physical activity level. These proportions of change were similar directly after diagnosis with a chronic disease, and in the years before or after diagnosis. Generalized estimating equations showed that there was no statistically significant effect of diagnosis with a chronic disease on levels of physical activity in women.\nConclusion: Despite the importance of physical activity for the management of chronic diseases, most women did not increase their physical activity after diagnosis. This illustrates a need for tailored interventions to enhance physical activity in newly diagnosed patients.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The minimum frequency of physical activity associated with reduced risk for onset of several chronic diseases is not well established. Therefore, this study examined, in a large sample of citizens from 16 European countries, the predictive value of physical activity frequency and intensity on the incidence of heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer of any subtype, breast cancer, and colon/rectum cancer.\nMethods: Using data from the longitudinal Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, the long-term associations of physical activity with incident diseases in people aged ≥50 years were investigated. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders were performed for each disease. Data were collected between 2004 and 2013 and analyzed in 2015.\nResults: Compared with people who never do physical activity, those doing vigorous physical activity once a week had a reduced risk of developing heart diseases (hazard ratio=0.80; 95% CI=0.70, 0.91), whereas those doing moderate physical activity once a week had a reduced risk of developing diabetes (hazard ratio=0.80; 95% CI=0.68, 0.95) and cerebrovascular diseases (hazard ratio=0.73; 95% CI 0.58, 0.91). The magnitude of the associations increased with higher frequencies for both moderate and vigorous physical activity. Consistent results were obtained in sensitivity analyses.\nConclusions: Doing physical activity once a week, which is less than current recommendations in terms of frequency, is associated with reduced risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes among middle-aged and older adults.",

    "title": "Time spent outdoors, activity levels, and chronic disease among American adults",
    "abstract": "Chronic diseases-including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity-account for over 60% of overall global mortality. Sedentary time increases the risk for chronic disease incidence and mortality, while moderate to vigorous physical activity is known to decrease risk. Most Americans spend at least half of their time sedentary, with a trend toward increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and few Americans achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Time spent outdoors has been associated with reduced sedentary time and increased physical activity among children/youth and the elderly, but few population-based studies have examined this relationship among working age adults who may face greater constraints on active, outdoor time. This study examines the relationship between time spent outdoors, activity levels, and several chronic health conditions among a population-based sample of working age American adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2009-2012. Findings provide evidence that time spent outdoors, on both work days and non-work days, is associated with less time spent sedentary and more time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Further, findings indicate that time spent outdoors is associated with lower chronic disease risk; while these associations are partially explained by activity levels, controlling for activity levels does not fully attenuate the relationship between time outdoors and chronic disease risk. While cross-sectional, study findings support the notion that increasing time spent outdoors could result in more active lifestyles and lower chronic disease risk. Future work should examine this relationship longitudinally to determine a causal direction. Additional work is also needed to identify mechanisms beyond physical activity, such as psychosocial stress, that could contribute to explaining the relationship between time spent outdoors and chronic disease risk.",

This study was designed to understand better the presence and strength of the relationship between physical activity and BP and to explore determinants of hemodynamic reactivity.\nDesign, setting, participants, & measurements: Twenty-four patients with CKD (mean age 69.5 yr; 3.1 antihypertensive drugs; estimated GFR 47 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), albumin/creatinine ratio 403 mg/g) were studied on three occasions during a 6-wk period with 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and simultaneous activity monitoring with wrist actigraphy.\nResults: Nondippers were found have a greater level of sleep activity compared with dippers, although the awake activity level was similar (7.06 versus 6.73) between groups (P = 0.042 for interaction). In 3587 BP activity pairs, hemodynamic reactivity was variable between individuals (systolic BP reactivity 1.06 [SD 10.50]; diastolic BP reactivity 0.89 [SD 7.80] heart rate reactivity 1.18 [SD 11.00]); those who were more sedentary had a greater increment in systolic BP compared with those who were less sedentary. Antihypertensive drugs blunted hemodynamic reactivity. Hemodynamic reactivity was greatest between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m., making this a vulnerable period for cardiovascular events.\nConclusions: Greater hemodynamic reactivity in sedentary people with CKD offers a possible and thus far unrecognized mechanism of cardiovascular damage. Besides reducing BP, antihypertensive drugs reduce hemodynamic reactivity, which offers another plausible mechanism of cardiovascular protection with their use.",

Three physical activity patterns were compared: active weekend warrior pattern (achieving ≥150 min MVPA per week and accumulating ≥50 % of total MVPA in 1-2 days), active regular pattern (achieving ≥150 min MVPA but not meeting active weekend warrior criteria per week), and inactive pattern (<150 min MVPA per week). The study outcomes included incident CKD and AKI, ascertained through self-report data and data linkage with primary care, hospital admissions, and death registry records.\nResults: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 1324 participants developed CKD and 1515 developed AKI.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic diseases, an increasing global concern, are prevalent in the low-income communities of South Africa, where rural health systems bear the double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. The Discovery Healthy Lifestyle Programme (DHLP) is a physical activity-based chronic disease prevention program that has been implemented in a low-income, rural setting in South Africa. The DHLP consists of both school- and primary healthcare clinic-based interventions for learners (Healthnutz) and adults (Live it Up), facilitated by teachers, nurses and community volunteers. The aim of this evaluation was to qualitatively assess the process by which the DHLP was implemented, identifying enabling factors and barriers.\nMethods: Data were collected in target communities at schools and clinics from semi-structured focus groups of program leaders and members, teachers and community members (n = 45), situational analyses of the school physical activity environment, informal community observations and informal interviews with program coordinators.\nResults: The target communities faced socioeconomic and health inequalities and remained under-resourced and under-served. In spite of these and other challenges, the DHLP was well received by community members and stakeholders. It was valued by respondents for its health and psychosocial outcomes, evidenced by increased knowledge and awareness of the importance of physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and positively altered perceptions of physical activity. Program implementers believed the Live it Up component was growing, and this suggested the sustainability of the program. There were, however, some concerns about the fidelity of the Healthnutz intervention, due to timetabling difficulties. Despite this, teachers were positive about the program and its value for their learners, staff and school. The community characteristics of being under-resourced and under-served appeared to positively influence DHLP implementation. Local government involvement in the DHLP resulted in greater ownership of the program, which enabled successful implementation.\nConclusions: This study presents a unique opportunity to assess the implementation and sustainability requirements of programs in environments of limited resources, considerable burden of infectious and chronic diseases and extensive socioeconomic challenges. The findings suggest that through enhancement of knowledge, transfer of appropriate skills and the provision of an enabling environment, participation in physical activity can be effectively promoted in a low-income, rural setting. Physical activity interventions that promote the participation and empowerment of rural communities can be feasible and accessible, thereby assisting in addressing the growing burden of chronic diseases in low-income.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although non-pharmacological smoking cessation measures have been widely used among smokers, current research evidence on the effects of smoking cessation is inconsistent and of mixed quality. Moreover, there is a lack of comprehensive evidence synthesis. This study seeks to systematically identify, describe, and evaluate the available evidence for non-pharmacological interventions in smoking populations through evidence mapping (EM), and to search for best-practice smoking cessation programs.\nMethods: A comprehensive search for relevant studies published from the establishment of the library to January 8, 2023, was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, Wan Fang, and VIP. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. The PRISMA statement and AMSTAR 2 tool were used to evaluate the report quality and methodology quality of systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs), respectively. Bubble plots were utilized to display information, such as the study population, intervention type, evidence quality, and original study sample size.\nResults: A total of 145 SRs/MAs regarding non-pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation were investigated, with 20 types of interventions identified. The most commonly used interventions were cognitive behaviour education (n = 32, 22.07%), professional counselling (n = 20, 13.79%), and non-nicotine electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) (n = 13, 8.97%). Among them, counselling and behavioural support can improve smoking cessation rates, but the effect varies depending on the characteristics of the support provided. These findings are consistent with previous SRs/MAs. The general population (n = 108, 74.48%) was the main cohort included in the SRs/MAs. The total score of PRISMA for the quality of the reports ranged from 8 to 27, and 13 studies (8.97%) were rated as high confidence, and nine studies (6.21%) as moderate confidence, in the AMSTAR 2 confidence rating.\nConclusions: The abstinence effect of cognitive behaviour education and money incentive intervention has advantages, and non-nicotine e-cigarettes appear to help some smokers transition to less harmful replacement tools. However, the methodological shortcomings of SRs/MAs should be considered. Therefore, to better guide future practice in the field of non-pharmacological smoking cessation, it is essential to improve the methodological quality of SRs and carry out high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs).",

In this systematic review, our objectives were: 1) to determine whether social media interventions for smoking cessation are feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective; 2) to identify approaches for recruiting subjects; and 3) to examine the specific intervention design components and strategies employed to promote user engagement and retention.\nMethods: We searched Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science through July 2016 and reference lists of relevant articles. Included studies described social media interventions for smoking cessation and must have reported outcomes related to feasibility, acceptability, usability, or smoking-related outcomes.\nResults: We identified 7 studies (all were published since 2014) that enrolled 9755 participants (median=136 [range 40 to 9042]). Studies mainly used Facebook (n=4) or Twitter (n=2), and emerged as feasible and acceptable. Five studies reported smoking-related outcomes such as greater abstinence, reduction in relapse, and an increase in quit attempts. Most studies (n=6) recruited participants using online or Facebook advertisements. Tailored content, targeted reminders, and moderated discussions were used to promote participant engagement.

    "title": "Efficacy of Smartphone Applications for Smoking Cessation: A Randomized Clinical Trial",
    "abstract": "Importance: Smoking is a leading cause of premature death globally. Smartphone applications for smoking cessation are ubiquitous and address barriers to accessing traditional treatments, yet there is limited evidence for their efficacy.\nObjective: To determine the efficacy of a smartphone application for smoking cessation based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) vs a National Cancer Institute smoking cessation application based on US clinical practice guidelines (USCPG).\nDesign, setting, and participants: A 2-group, stratified, double-blind, individually randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 27, 2017, to September 28, 2018, among 2415 adult cigarette smokers (n = 1214 for the ACT-based smoking cessation application group and n = 1201 for the USCPG-based smoking cessation application group) with 3-, 6-, and 12-month postrandomization follow-up. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol. Follow-up data collection started on August 26, 2017, and ended at the last randomized participant's 12-month follow-up survey on December 23, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 25 to April 3, 2020. The primary analysis was performed on a complete-case basis, with intent-to-treat missing as smoking and multiple imputation sensitivity analyses.\nInterventions: iCanQuit, an ACT-based smoking cessation application, which taught acceptance of smoking triggers, and the National Cancer Institute QuitGuide, a USCPG-based smoking cessation application, which taught avoidance of smoking triggers.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were 7-day PPA at 12 months after randomization, prolonged abstinence, 30-day and 7-day PPA at 3 and 6 months after randomization, missing data imputed with multiple imputation or coded as smoking, and cessation of all tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) at 12 months after randomization.\nResults: Participants were 2415 adult cigarette smokers (1700 women [70.4%]; 1666 White individuals [69.0%] and 868 racial/ethnic minorities [35.9%]; mean [SD] age at enrollment, 38.2 [10.9] years) from all 50 US states. The 3-month follow-up data retention rate was 86.7% (2093), the 6-month retention rate was 88.4% (2136), and the 12-month retention rate was 87.2% (2107). For the primary outcome of 30-day PPA at the 12-month follow-up, iCanQuit participants had 1.49 times higher odds of quitting smoking compared with QuitGuide participants (28.2% [293 of 1040] vs 21.1% [225 of 1067]; odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.83; P < .001). Effect sizes were very similar and statistically significant for 7-day PPA at the 12-month follow-up (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.63; P = .002), prolonged abstinence at the 12-month follow-up (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.45-2.76; P < .001), abstinence from all tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) at the 12-month follow-up (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.28-1.99; P < .001), 30-day PPA at 3-month follow-up (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.68-2.89; P < .001), 30-day PPA at 6-month follow-up (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.63-2.54; P < .001), 7-day PPA at 3-month follow-up (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.64-2.54; P < .001), and 7-day PPA at 6-month follow-up (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.42-2.10; P < .001).\nConclusions and relevance: This trial provides evidence that, compared with a USCPG-based smartphone application, an ACT-based smartphone application was more efficacious for quitting cigarette smoking and thus can be an impactful treatment option.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02724462.",

This article examines the current state of research and practice for older adults and smoking cessation interventions. For over 17 years, the health care literature has mandated that people of all ages be provided with smoking cessation interventions. However, smoking cessation interventions are offered to older adults at suboptimal rates. Nurses, especially those caring for clients in the inpatient setting, have an opportunity to provide smoking cessation interventions to older smokers. Recent research has shown that older smokers, particularly those hospitalized with cardiovascular disease, can quit at high rates when provided an intervention. Furthermore, use of nicotine replacement therapy has been shown to be safe and efficacious among older smokers with cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions prior to surgery and examine smoking cessation rates at 6 months follow-up. The Cochrane Library Database, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Medline, and Cinahl databases were searched using the terms: smok$, smoking cessation, tobacco, cigar$, preop$, operati$, surg$, randomi*ed control$ trial, intervention, program$, cessation, abstinen$, quit. Further articles were obtained from reference lists. The search was limited to articles on adults, written in English and published up to December 2006. Only randomized control trials (RCTs) that incorporated smoking cessation interventions to patients awaiting elective surgery were included. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed by all the authors. The findings revealed that short-term quit rates (or a reduction by more than half of normal daily rate) ranged from 18% to 93% in patients receiving a smoking intervention (mean 55%), compared with a range of 2%-65% of controls (mean = 27.7%). Two studies examined smoking status at 6 months but these revealed no significant difference in abstinence rates between patients who had received an intervention and those that had not. Studies that incorporated counseling in addition to nicotine replacement therapy appeared to show greater benefits. It is concluded that smoking cessation interventions prior to surgery are effective in helping patients to quit smoking. However, such effects appear to be short-lived. Future research needs to examine intervention and patient factors to see whether tailoring the smoking cessation intervention specifically to the patient improves overall abstinence rates.",

Smoking cessation before surgery reduces complications; however, information on the risks of smoking and benefits of quitting on surgical outcomes are not regularly provided to patients. It is especially important for smokers to quit now because they are at increased risk of serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a program for smoking cessation in a preanesthesia clinic associated with a southwestern medical center to increase motivation to quit smoking. The evidence-based program involved development of a provider toolkit, a referral process, provider education, and program evaluation. After provider education, the program commenced. Of the 134 current smokers encountered over a 16-week period, most were ready to quit within 30 days (n = 92, 68.66%). Of the smokers who were ready to quit, 50 (37.31%) accepted referral for smoking cessation counseling, treatment, or both. Only 13 (9.70%) of the 134 smokers were already receiving treatment. This program enabled providers to feel more comfortable discussing the implications of smoking, advising smokers to quit, providing education materials, and offering referral services at the appropriate stage of readiness for behavior change.",

This systematic review will examine the literature on smoking cessation interventions for Hispanic adults in the USA to assess (1) the availability of interventions, (2) the methodological quality of the studies evaluating the interventions and (3) the efficacy of the interventions.\nMethods and analysis: A systematic literature search will be conducted, in English with no date limits, through the following databases starting at year of inception: Medical Allied Health Literature, Embase, American Psychology Association Psychology Articles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, ScienceDirect, Health & Medicine Collection and Web of Science Core Collection. Trial registries and grey literature sources will be searched to identify ongoing or unpublished studies. Literature search will be rerun prior to eventual submission of the review to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies. Quantitative studies evaluating the efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention (ie, smoking cessation as a measured outcome) for Hispanic adult smokers in the USA will be included in the systematic review. Two authors will independently identify relevant studies, extract data and conduct quality and risk of bias assessments. Discrepancies in coding will be discussed between the two reviewers and pending disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. First, the quality of all studies will be assessed, then randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will be further evaluated for risk of bias using Cochrane's Risk of Bias Tool. All eligible studies will be summarised descriptively. If data allow, the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions tested in RCTs, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, will be quantitatively estimated using ORs and 95% CIs.

    "abstract": "Smoking cessation is essential after the diagnosis of cancer to improve clinical outcomes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a systematic review of research on smoking cessation in the context of cancer care with an emphasis on nursing contributions to the field. Data sources included research reports of smoking cessation interventions conducted in people with cancer. Nineteen primary studies were reviewed. High intensity interventions, targeting multiple behaviors, and/or using a multicomponent intervention that included pharmacotherapy, behavioral counseling, and social support were characteristics of the most successful treatments for tobacco dependence. The majority of interventions were conducted in adults with smoking-related malignancies during acute phases of illness. The most striking finding was that more than one half of the studies tested the efficacy of nurse-delivered interventions. Conceptual and methodological issues that can be improved in future studies include: using theoretical frameworks to specify how the intervention will affect outcomes, ensuring adequate sample sizes, using biochemical verification to monitor smoking outcomes, and using standardized outcome measures of abstinence. Although effective interventions are available for healthy populations, further research is needed to determine if tailored cessation interventions are needed for patients with cancer. To provide optimal quality care it is imperative that delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions be integrated into the cancer treatment trajectory. Multiple barriers, including patient and nurse attitudes toward smoking and lack of knowledge related to tobacco treatment, prevent translating evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment into clinical practice. Further nursing research is needed to address these barriers.",

Despite known harms of nicotine exposure among teens, there are no empirically tested vaping cessation interventions.\nObjective: To compare the effectiveness of a text message program for nicotine vaping cessation among adolescents with assessment-only control.\nDesign, setting, and participants: A parallel, 2-group, double-blind, individually randomized clinical trial with follow-ups at 1 and 7 months after randomization was conducted from October 1, 2021, to October 18, 2023. Participants were recruited via social media ads; the intervention was delivered via text message; and assessments were completed online or by telephone. Eligible individuals were US residents aged 13 to 17 years who reported past 30-day e-cigarette use, were interested in quitting within 30 days, and owned a mobile phone with an active text message plan. To optimize study retention, all participants received monthly assessments via text message about e-cigarette use.\nInterventions: Assessment-only controls (n = 744) received only study retention text messages. Intervention participants (n = 759) also received an automated, interactive text message program for vaping cessation that delivers cognitive and behavioral coping skills training and social support.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was self-reported 30-day point-prevalence abstinence from vaping at 7 months analyzed as intention-to-treat, with missingness coded as vaping.\nResults: Among n = 1503 adolescents randomized, average age was 16.4 (SD, 0.8) years.

Cytisinicline, a partial agonist at α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has demonstrated smoking cessation efficacy in 1 US trial. Additional evidence is needed.\nObjective: To reproduce the findings of the efficacy and tolerability of cytisinicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation and to test its effect on nicotine craving as a mechanism of action.\nDesign, settings, and participants: This was a 3-group double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 replication randomized clinical trial (ORCA-3) conducted at 20 clinical trial sites in the US from January 2022 to March 2023. It compared 6 and 12 weeks of a novel cytisinicline regimen to placebo among adults who smoked 10 or more cigarettes daily and sought to quit. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 3-mg cytisinicline 3 times daily for 12 weeks; 3-mg cytisinicline 3 times daily for 6 weeks followed by placebo for 6 weeks; or placebo 3 times daily for 12 weeks. The follow-up period was 24 weeks, and all groups received behavioral support. Data analyses were performed from May 3, 2023, to March 20, 2024.\nInterventions: Cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks; cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 6 weeks followed by placebo for 6 weeks; or placebo 3 times daily for 12 weeks.\nMain outcomes and measures: Biochemically verified (carbon monoxide <10 ppm) continuous smoking abstinence during the last 4 weeks of 6- and 12-week treatments (primary outcome) and from end of treatment to 24 weeks (secondary outcome); Questionnaire of Smoking Urges; incidence of adverse events.\nResults: Of 792 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [11.8] years; 439 [55.4%] female; mean [SD] cigarettes/d, 20.4 [7.5]), 628 (79.3%) completed the trial. Primary and secondary outcomes were significantly higher for both cytisinicline groups vs placebo. For 6-week treatment, 39 cytisinicline participants (14.8%) vs 16 placebo participants (6.0%) were abstinent during weeks 3 to 6 (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.6; P < .001). For 12-week treatment, 80 cytisinicline participants (30.3%) vs 25 placebo participants (9.4%) were abstinent during weeks 9 to 12 (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.6-7.3; P < .001). Continuous abstinence rates for the 6-week treatment were 6.8% (cytisinicline) vs 1.1% (placebo) from weeks 3 to 24 . Continuous abstinence rates for the 12-week treatment were 20.5% (cytisinicline) vs 4.2% (placebo) for weeks 9 to 24. Reduction in craving at week 6 was greater for cytisinicline than placebo (-15.2 points [95% CI, -16.4 to -14.0] vs -12.0 points [95% CI, -13.5 to -10.5]; P < .001). Cytisinicline was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events.\nConclusions and relevance: The findings of the ORCA phase 3 trial reaffirms the efficacy and tolerability of cytisinicline at both 6- and 12-week treatment for smoking cessation, with benefits extending through 24 weeks. As a mechanism of effect, cytisinicline mitigated nicotine craving.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05206370.",

This manuscript outlines proposed methodology for scoping review that aims to describe the knowledge gaps for local-level smoking cessation interventions in Japan, their implementation barriers and facilitators, and the use of implementation strategies.\nMethods and analysis: A scoping review will be conducted using the updated guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-extension for Scoping Reviews to systematically search peer-reviewed journal articles and grey literature to identify studies on smoking cessation interventions in Japan. The six-stage scoping review model will involve (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting data; (5) collating, summarising and reporting the results; and (6) consultation exercise. Since there is little information available on the implementation context in the literature, we will use grey literature to identify organisations implementing smoking cessation interventions and conduct a cross-sectional survey among them to supplement the information gap. Based on a literature review, findings will be organised on smoking cessation interventions in local settings (ie, communities, workplaces, schools and hospitals) at the population, provider and individual levels in Japan to understand knowledge gaps. We will adopt the consolidated framework for implementation research to identify implementation barriers and facilitators, and the expert recommendations for implementing change to identify implementation strategies.\nEthics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical committee approval. The scoping review method will be robust in searching available smoking cessation interventions in Japan.

These providers are encouraged to work together through interdisciplinary collaboration and to implement evidence-based strategies as outlined in the PPOD toolkit. The toolkit encourages healthcare providers to ask, advise, and assist patients in their efforts to engage in risk reduction and healthy behaviors, including smoking cessation as an important risk factor. While individual PPOD providers have demonstrated effective smoking cessation interventions in adults with other acute and chronic systemic diseases, they lack specific application and focus on adults with diabetes.

Results show that surprisingly little effort has been put forth to examine and develop these theories within the context of clinical interventions, despite the claims of importance. For example, the relationship between stages of readiness of change and smoking cessation outcome has not been examined. Despite the complexity of smoking behaviors (quitting, relapsing, maintaining, occasional smoking and so on), the concept of self-efficacy was mostly measured on single occasions over the course of most studies reviewed; multiple measurements of concepts were not utilized in the randomized controlled trials.

    "title": "Seeing New Opportunities to Help Smokers Quit: A UK National Survey of Optometrist-Delivered Smoking Cessation Behavioral Support Interventions",
    "abstract": "Background: Smoking is a risk factor for various eye conditions. Brief smoking cessation interventions have demonstrated effectiveness when delivered by a range of health care professionals. Optometrists are well placed in the community to advise otherwise healthy smokers to quit, yet remain relatively neglected in smoking cessation research and policy. In a national survey, this study investigated self-reported practices of UK optometrists for delivering brief tobacco smoking cessation interventions to patients.\nMethods: A randomly selected sample of 1200 optometrists out of the 9000 optometrists registered on the UK College of Optometrists database were invited to complete a 40-item, web-based survey assessing: training related to smoking cessation, current practice (ie, the proportion of patients to which components of very brief advice [Ask, Advise, Assist] and other evidence-based smoking cessation behavior change techniques were delivered), and barriers/enablers to intervention delivery.\nResults: In total, 408 (34%) responses were received. Most (83%) optometrists received no training in practical skills for delivering smoking cessation support. A third (34%) routinely assessed smoking status. Fewer self-reported advising smokers to quit (22%), offering assistance (via referral to dedicated services) (3%), or advice on smoking cessation medications (2%). Perceived barriers included insufficient knowledge/training (81%) and time (65%). Optometrists were more likely to assess and advise on smoking cessation if they practiced in Scotland, χ2(2) = 32.95, p < .001; an independent optometry practice, χ2(1) = 4.27, p = .39; or had received smoking cessation training, χ2(1) = 13.1, p < .001.\nConclusions: Substantial gaps exist in UK optometrists' current smoking cessation training and practice. Evidence-based training resources are needed to support the implementation of smoking cessation interventions into routine optometry practice.\nImplications: Optometrists are well placed in the community to deliver brief advice interventions to a large population of smokers. This survey provides a comprehensive description of current UK optometry practice related to the provision of evidence-based brief tobacco smoking cessation interventions to patients. Although optometrists perceive advising on smoking cessation as part of their role, numerous substantial gaps in current practice and training remain, which need to be addressed through targeted interventions to increase implementation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many best practice smoking cessation programs use fully automated internet interventions designed for nonmobile personal computers (desktop computers, laptops, and tablets). A relatively small number of smoking cessation interventions have been designed specifically for mobile devices such as smartphones.\nObjective: This study examined the efficacy and usage patterns of two internet-based best practices smoking cessation interventions.\nMethods: Overall, 1271 smokers who wanted to quit were randomly assigned to (1) MobileQuit (designed for-and constrained its use to-mobile devices, included text messaging, and embodied tunnel information architecture) or (2) QuitOnline (designed for nonmobile desktop or tablet computers, did not include text messages, and used a flexible hybrid matrix-hierarchical information architecture). Primary outcomes included self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Program visits were unobtrusively assessed (frequency, duration, and device used for access).\nResults: Significantly more MobileQuit participants than QuitOnline participants reported quitting smoking. Abstinence rates using intention-to-treat analysis were 20.7% (131/633) vs 11.4% (73/638) at 3 months, 24.6% (156/633) vs 19.3% (123/638) at 6 months, and 15.8% (100/633) vs 8.8% (56/638) for both 3 and 6 months. Using Complete Cases, MobileQuit's advantage was significant at 3 months (45.6% [131/287] vs 28.4% [73/257]) and the combined 3 and 6 months (40.5% [100/247] vs 25.9% [56/216]) but not at 6 months (43.5% [156/359] vs 34.4% [123/329]). Participants in both conditions reported their program was usable and helpful. MobileQuit participants visited their program 5 times more frequently than did QuitOnline participants. Consistent with the MobileQuit's built-in constraint, 89.46% (8820/9859) of its visits were made on an intended mobile device, whereas 47.72% (691/1448) of visits to QuitOnline used an intended nonmobile device. Among MobileQuit participants, 76.0% (459/604) used only an intended mobile device, 23.0% (139/604) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 0.1% (6/604) used only a nonmobile device. Among QuitOnline participants, 31.3% (137/438) used only the intended nonmobile devices, 16.7% (73/438) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 52.1% (228/438) used only mobile devices (primarily smartphones).\nConclusions: This study provides evidence for optimizing intervention design for smartphones over a usual care internet approach in which interventions are designed primarily for use on nonmobile devices such as desktop computers, laptops. or tablets. We propose that future internet interventions should be designed for use on all of the devices (multiple screens) that users prefer. We forecast that the approach of designing internet interventions for mobile vs nonmobile devices will be replaced by internet interventions that use a single Web app designed to be responsive (adapt to different screen sizes and operating systems), share user data across devices, embody a pervasive information architecture, and complemented by text message notifications.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01952236; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01952236 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6zdSxqbf8).",

    "abstract": "Background: Novel approaches to engage community smokers in smoking cessation are needed as smokers typically lack motivation to quit or use evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment. Mobile instant messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) are widely used but under-studied as a mobile health modality for delivering smoking cessation support. This paper presents the rationale and study design of a trial which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a chat-based intervention using mobile instant messaging combined with brief interventions for community smokers.\nMethods: This is a two-arm, parallel, accessor-blinded, pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial on an estimated 1172 daily cigarette smokers aged ≥18 years proactively recruited from 68 community sites (cluster) throughout Hong Kong. Subjects in intervention group received three months of chat-based, instant messaging support guided by acceptance and commitment therapy and other behavioural change techniques, integrated with brief advice and active referral to a smoking cessation service using the AWARD (Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer, Do-it-again) intervention model. Control group received brief advice to quit plus a self-help booklet at baseline. Outcomes were assessed at 1-, 2-, 3- and 6-month after baseline. The primary outcome is abstinence validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (<4 ppm) and salivary cotinine (<10 ng/mL) at 6-month after baseline. Primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat.\nComments: This is the first trial examining the effectiveness of a chat-based cessation support programme combined with brief interventions in promoting abstinence. The intervention model can be adapted for other behavioural change treatments and more advanced digital smoking cessation intervention.",

    "abstract": "Background: Brief interventions for smoking cessation and alcohol moderation may contribute considerably to the prevention of cancer among populations at risk, such as cancer survivors, in addition to improving their general wellbeing. There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based brief health behaviour interventions. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness, patient-level cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two new online theory-based self-help interventions among adult cancer survivors in the Netherlands. One of the interventions focuses on alcohol moderation, the other on smoking cessation. Both interventions are tailored to cancer survivors.\nMethods: Effectiveness will be assessed in two separate, nearly identical 2-armed RCTs: alcohol moderation (AM RCT) and smoking cessation (SC RCT). Participants are randomly allocated to either the intervention groups or the control groups. In the intervention groups, participants have access to one of the newly developed interventions. In the control groups, participants receive an online static information brochure on alcohol (AM RCT) or smoking (SC RCT). Main study outcome parameters are the number of drinks post-randomisation (AM RCT) and tobacco abstinence (SC RCT). In addition, cost-data and possible effect moderators and mediators will be assessed. Both treatments are internet-based minimally guided self-help interventions: MyCourse - Moderate Drinking (in Dutch: MijnKoers - Minderen met Drinken) and MyCourse - Quit Smoking (MijnKoers - Stoppen met Roken). They are based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Both interventions are optimized in collaboration with the target population of cancer survivors in focus groups and interviews, and in collaboration with several experts on eHealth, smoking cessation, alcohol misuse and cancer survivorship.\nDiscussion: The present study will add to scientific knowledge on the (cost-)effectiveness of internet-based self-help interventions to aid in smoking cessation or alcohol moderation, working mechanisms and impact on quality of life of cancer survivors. If found effective, these interventions can contribute to providing evidence-based psychosocial oncology care to a growing population of cancer survivors.\nTrial registration: Trials are prospectively registered in The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR6011 (SC RCT), NTR6010 (AM RCT) on 1 September 2016.",

    "abstract": "Background: Smoking cessation is an important factor in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiac events. Although multiple clinical trials have examined the efficacy of various smoking cessation aids, a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of smoking cessation aids has not been done.\nMethods: This paper reviews the effects of smoking on coronary artery disease. In addition, we identify randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy and safety of smoking cessation aids from the years 1970 to 2004. We then pooled the trial results for 6- and 12-month rates of continuous smoking abstinence.\nResults: The 4 principal mechanisms of cardiovascular damage caused by cigarette smoking are induction of a hypercoagulable state, reduction of oxygen delivery because of carbon monoxide, coronary vasoconstriction, and nicotine-induced hemodynamic effects. Our review of clinical trials suggests that each smoking cessation aid improved continuous smoking abstinence rates at both 6 and 12 months compared with placebo. The 12-month abstinence rates for the active versus placebo treatments were the following: nicotine patch 11.1% versus 5.5%, nicotine gum 27.3% versus 16.5%, nicotine inhaler 16.9% versus 9.1%, bupropion 18.5% versus 6.6%, and behavioral therapy 20.0% versus 13.9%.\nConclusions: Several smoking-related mechanisms are responsible for the development of atherosclerosis and the induction of cardiac events. Smoking cessation aids effect a modest increase in smoking abstinence at 12 months compared with placebo. In spite the apparent success of cessation aids, smoking relapse rates are quite high.",

This review examined the number and type of published smoking cessation studies conducted in low-socioeconomic status (low-SES) and disadvantaged population groups.\nMethods: A systematic database search was conducted for two time periods: 2000-2004 (TP1) and 2008-2012 (TP2). Publications that examined smoking cessation in a low-SES or disadvantaged population were coded by: population of interest; study type (reviews, non-data based publications, data-based publications (descriptive, measurement and intervention research)); and country. Intervention studies were coded in accordance with the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care data collection checklist and use of biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence was assessed.\nResults: 278 citations were included. Research output (i.e., all study types) had increased from TP1 27% to TP2 73% (χ²=73.13, p<0.001), however, the proportion of data-based research had not significantly increased from TP1 and TP2: descriptive (TP1=23% vs. TP2=33%) or intervention (TP1=77% vs. TP2=67%). The proportion of intervention studies adopting biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence had significantly decreased from TP1 to TP2 with an increased reliance on self-reported abstinence (TP1=12% vs. TP2=36%).\nConclusions: The current research output is not ideal or optimal to decrease smoking rates.

    "title": "Smoking cessation with smartphone applications (SWAPP): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",
    "abstract": "Background: Tobacco smoking remains one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real-time. The social context of smokers has, however, been neglected in smartphone apps promoting smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of a smartphone app in which smokers quit smoking with the help of a social network member.\nMethods: This protocol describes the design of a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Participants of this study are adult smokers who smoke at least one cigarette per day and intend to quit smoking at a self-set quit date. Blocking as means of group-balanced randomization is used to allocate participants to intervention or control conditions. Both intervention and control group use a smartphone-compatible device for measuring their daily smoking behavior objectively via exhaled carbon monoxide. In addition, the intervention group is instructed to use the SmokeFree Buddy app, a multicomponent app that also facilitates smoking-cessation specific social support from a buddy over a smartphone application. All participants fill out a baseline diary for three consecutive days and are invited to the lab for a background assessment. They subsequently participate in an end-of-day diary phase from 7 days before and until 20 days after a self-set quit date. Six months after the self-set quit date a follow-up diary for three consecutive days takes place. The primary outcome measures are daily self-reported and objectively-assessed smoking abstinence and secondary outcome measures are daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked.\nDiscussion: This is the first study examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation mobile intervention using the SmokeFree Buddy app compared to a control group in a real-life setting around a self-set quit date using a portable objective measure to assess smoking abstinence. Opportunities and challenges with running studies with smoking participants and certain design-related decisions are discussed.\nTrial registration: This trial was prospectively registered on 04/04/2018 at ISRCTNregistry: ISRCTN11154315 .",

    "abstract": "Objective: To identify predictors of smoking cessation success or failure with and without transdermal nicotine patch treatment.\nDesign: Two independent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies using the nicotine patch assessing outcome at the end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up; each study used a different mode of adjuvant counseling.\nPatients: Subjects were daily smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes per day), aged 21 to 65 years with expired air carbon monoxide levels of at least 10 ppm, and motivated to quit. Eighty-eight subjects participated in study 1, and 112 subjects participated in study 2.\nIntervention: Study 1 consisted of 8 weeks of 22-mg nicotine patch therapy with intensive group counseling. Study 2 consisted of 4 weeks of 22-mg nicotine patch therapy and 2 weeks of 11-mg nicotine patch therapy with brief individual counseling.\nMain outcome measures: The prediction of smoking cessation (at end of treatment and after 6 months) based on pretreatment and intratreatment measures in smokers using active or placebo nicotine patches.\nResults: Pretreatment markers, such as the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire score, number of cigarettes smoked per day, years smoked, expired air carbon monoxide level, or baseline blood nicotine and cotinine levels, showed no consistent relationship with successful smoking cessation across both studies. Of the intratreatment markers examined, withdrawal severity and nicotine replacement levels also were not consistently predictive of cessation success. However, any smoking during the second week of treatment was a consistent and powerful predictor of failure at the end of treatment and after 6 months. Among active nicotine patch patients who smoked at all during week 2 after quitting, 83% and 97% (studies 1 and 2, respectively) were smoking at 6-month follow-up. Conversely, abstinence during the second week of treatment predicted successful smoking cessation. Among active nicotine patch patients who were totally abstinent during week 2 after quitting, 46% and 41% (studies 1 and 2, respectively) were abstinent at 6-month follow-up. Of all nicotine patch patients in both studies who were smoking at 6-month follow-up, 74% began smoking during week 1 or 2. Among all placebo patch patients who were smoking at 6-month follow-up, 86% began smoking during week 1 or 2.\nConclusions: Smoking status (abstinent or smoking) during the first 2 weeks of nicotine patch therapy, particularly week 2, was highly correlated with clinical outcome and can serve as a powerful predictor of smoking cessation. Early smoking behavior also predicted outcome among placebo patch users. Traditional measures of dependence are not consistently predictive of cessation success. Clinicians are advised to emphasize the importance of total abstinence after a quit attempt and to follow-up with patients within the first 2 weeks of quitting; smoking during this critical time should be assessed and treatment may be altered as appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Background: Considering the extreme shortage of smoking cessation services in China, and the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of mobile phone-based text message interventions for quitting smoking in other countries, here we propose a study of \"the efficacy of mobile phone-based text message interventions ('Happy Quit') for smoking cessation in China\". The primary objective of this proposed project is to assess whether a program of widely accessed mobile phone-based text message interventions ('Happy Quit') will be effective at helping people in China who smoke, to quit. Based on the efficacy of previous studies in smoking cessation, we hypothesize that 'Happy Quit' will be an effective, feasible and affordable smoking cessation program in China.\nMethods/design: In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China, about 2000 smokers willing to make a quit attempt will be randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomization system that includes a minimization algorithm balancing for sex (male, female), age (19-34 or >34 years), educational level (≤ or >12 years), and Fagerstrom score for nicotine addiction (≤5, >5), to 'Happy Quit', comprising motivational messages and behavioral-change support, or to a control group that receives text messages unrelated to quitting. Messages will be developed to be suitable for Chinese. A pilot study will be conducted before the intervention to modify the library of messages and interventions. The primary outcome will be self-reported continuous smoking abstinence. A secondary outcome will be point prevalence of abstinence. Abstinence will be assessed at six time points (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks post-intervention). A third outcome will be reductions in number of cigarettes smoked per day.\nDiscussion/implications: The results will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between need and services received for smoking cessation interventions and tobacco use prevention in China. It will also serve as mHealth model for extending the public health significance of other interventions, such as mental health interventions.\nTrial registration: NCT02693626 (Registration data April 11, 2016).",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Tobacco is the world's leading preventable cause of disease and death. People with depression are twice as likely to smoke and are less responsive to standard tobacco treatments as compared with the general population. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled trials of smoking cessation treatment for smokers with current or historical depression found that adding mood management to usual smoking treatment improved quit rates. However, the review did not examine if variation in intervention delivery or intervention functions impacted on treatment effectiveness.With the aim of providing information to develop tailored approaches to treating smoking for people with current depression, we will add-on to the Cochrane review in three ways: (1) use the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist to determine if variations in mood management delivery have impact on intervention effectiveness, (2) use the Taxonomy of Behaviour Change techniques for smoking cessation to examine which behaviour change functions are most effective for smoking cessation in people with current depression and (3) examine the difference in change in depression scores between intervention and control arms.\nMethods and analysis: We will include randomised controlled trials of smokers with current depression as identified by a previous Cochrane review and the in-progress update of this Cochrane review. We will use meta-regression to examine (1) if variations in delivery of mood management impact on smoking cessation intervention effectiveness, (2) determine which behaviour change functions are most effective for smoking cessation and (3) use meta-analysis of the difference in change in depression scores between treatment arms from baseline to follow-up to determine if offering smoking cessation treatment causes psychological harm.\nEthics and dissemination: Ethical approval is not required for this study. We will disseminate the findings of this work at national and international conferences, and to relevant patient panels.\nProspero registration number: CRD42017070741.",

    "title": "Smoking cessation Through Optimisation of clinical care in Pregnancy: the STOP randomised controlled trial",
    "abstract": "Background: Cigarette smoking negatively impacts on maternal and fetal health. Smoking cessation is one of the few interventions capable of improving pregnancy outcomes. Despite the risks, the most effective antenatal model of care for smokers is still unclear, and specific recommendations for screening for fetal growth restriction are absent.\nMethods: This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a dedicated smoking cessation clinic versus routine antenatal care as an intervention to reduce cigarette smoking behaviour. Smoking mothers randomised to the Smoking cessation Through Optimisation of clinical care in Pregnancy (STOP) clinic will have all antenatal care provided by a team comprising an obstetrician, a midwife, and a smoking cessation practitioner. This intervention includes ultrasound screening for fetal growth restriction. The control arm comprises two groups: one receiving standard care with ultrasound screening for fetal growth restriction, and one receiving standard care with ultrasound screening for growth restriction only if clinically indicated by their healthcare provider. Four hundred and fifty women will be recruited and randomised to either intervention or control arms stratifying for age, parity, and history of fetal growth restriction.\nResults: The primary outcome is self-reported, continuous abstinence from smoking between the quit date and end of pregnancy, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide or urinary cotinine. The quit date is targeted as being at or before 16 weeks' gestation and no further than 28 weeks' gestation. The secondary outcomes are a set of variables including maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, neonatal complications and delivery outcomes, smoking and psychological outcomes, and qualitative measures.\nConclusions: Despite much research into cigarette smoking in pregnancy, the optimal model of care for these women is still unknown. This study has the potential to improve the model of antenatal care provided to pregnant women who smoke and to improve outcomes for both mother and infant.\nTrial registration: ISRCTN11214785 .

    "abstract": "Counseling and pharmacotherapy are smoking cessation interventions whose effectiveness has been widely demonstrated. Different pharmacologic treatment options exist with similar efficacy : notably nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion. Providers can promote therapeutic adherence and the chances of successful quitting by involving patients in the choice of medication and incorporating their preferences in the decision process. The concept of shared decision-making is based on an exchange between doctor and patient in medical situations with several reasonable options. Decision aids support this approach by facilitating the transmission of information, communication and patient involvement. Despite opportunities for shared decision-making during the smoking cessation process, few decision aids are available. This article summarizes current knowledge in this field and its application to the process of smoking cessation. Shared decision making in smoking cessation is illustrated by a decision aid created to facilitate the choice between different smoking cessation medications.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Nicotine dependence is a disease, and tobacco use is related to 6 million deaths annually worldwide. Recently, in many countries, there has been growing interest in the use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) methods, especially acupuncture, as therapeutic interventions for smoking cessation. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness of T&CM interventions on smoking cessation.\nMethods and analysis: The STOP (Stop Tobacco Programme using traditional Korean medicine) study is designed to be a pragmatic, open-label, randomised pilot trial. This trial will evaluate whether adding T&CM methods (ie, ear and body acupuncture, aromatherapy) to conventional cessation methods (ie, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), counselling) increases smoking cessation rates. Forty participants over 19 years old who are capable of communicating in Korean will be recruited. They will be current smokers who meet one of the following criteria: (1) smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day, (2) smoke less than 10 cigarettes a day and previously failed to cease smoking, or (3) smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day and have a nicotine dependence score (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence) of 4 points or more. The trial will consist of 4 weeks of treatment and a 20 week follow-up period. A statistician will perform the statistical analyses for both the intention-to-treat (all randomly assigned participants) and per-protocol (participants who completed the trial without any protocol deviations) data using SAS 9.1.3.\nEthics and dissemination: This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Dunsan Korean Medicine Hospital of Daejeon University (IRB reference no: DJDSKH-15-BM-11-1, Protocol No. version 4.1.).The protocol will be reapproved by IRB if it requires amendment. The trial will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, 7th version (2013). This study is designed to minimise the risk to participants, and the investigators will explain the study to the participants in detail. As an ethical clinical trial, the control group will also be given conventional cessation treatments, including NRT and counselling. Participants will be screened and provided with a registration number to protect their personal information. Informed consent will be obtained from the participants prior to enrolling them in the trial.

    "title": "Projected cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction",
    "abstract": "Background: As many as 70% of smokers with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continue to smoke after hospital discharge despite high rates of inpatient smoking cessation counseling. Supportive contact after discharge improves quit rates but is rarely used.\nMethods: Using data from a meta-analysis of randomized trials of smoking cessation interventions and other published sources, we developed a Monte Carlo model to project health and economic outcomes for a hypothetical US cohort of 327,600 smokers hospitalized with AMI. We compared routine care, consisting of advice to quit smoking, with counseling with supportive follow-up, consisting of routine care and follow-up telephone calls from a nurse after discharge. Primary outcomes were number of smokers, AMIs, and deaths averted; health care and productivity costs; cost per quitter; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year.\nResults: Implementation of smoking cessation counseling with follow-up contact for the 2010 cohort of hospitalized smokers would create 50,230 new quitters, cost $27.3 million in nurse wages and materials, and prevent 1380 nonfatal AMIs and 7860 deaths. During a 10-year period, it would save $22.1 million in reduced hospitalizations but increase health care costs by $166.4 million, primarily through increased longevity. Productivity costs from premature death would fall by $1.99 billion and nonmedical expenditures would increase by $928 million, for a net positive value to society of $894 million. The program would cost $540 per quitter considering only intervention costs. Cost-effectiveness would be $5050 per quality-adjusted life-year. Results were sensitive to the utility and incidence of nonfatal AMI and the potential effect of pharmacotherapies.\nConclusion: Smoking cessation counseling with supportive contact after discharge is potentially cost-effective and may reduce the incidence of smoking and its associated adverse health events and social costs.",

The aim of this study was to tailor CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)-SPI (Social and Psychological Interventions) guidelines to improve reporting of trials of behavioural interventions to promote smoking cessation.\nMethod: Informed by missing data from the IC-SMOKE (Intervention and Comparison group support provided in SMOKing cEssation) systematic review project, this study used a multi-stage Delphi process to examine which items could be added or modified to improve the reporting of smoking cessation trials. The first stage involved an on-line survey of 17 international experts in smoking cessation and trial methodology voting on the importance of items for inclusion in the updated guidelines. This was followed by a face-to-face expert consensus meeting attended by 15 of these experts, where the final inclusion and exclusion of new items and modifications were agreed upon. A nine-point Likert scale was used to establish consensus, with suggested modifications requiring agreement of 75% or more. Disagreements in the first stage were presented again at the second stage for discussion and a second round of voting. Only items which reached the threshold for agreement were included.\nResults: The experts agreed on the inclusion of 10 new items and the specification of 12 existing items. This included modifications that could apply to trials more widely (e.g. the rationale for the comparator), but also modifications that were very specific to smoking cessation trials (e.g. the reporting of smoking cessation outcomes).\nConclusions: A Delphi study has developed a modified CONSORT-SPI guideline (CONSORT-SPI-SMOKE) to improve the reporting of trials of behavioural interventions to promote smoking cessation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Smoking is highly prevalent among people who have experience of severe mental ill health, contributing to their poor physical health. Despite the 'culture' of smoking in mental health services, people with severe mental ill health often express a desire to quit smoking; however, the services currently available to aid quitting are those which are widely available to the general population and may not be suitable or effective for people with severe mental ill health. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a bespoke smoking-cessation intervention specifically targeted at people with severe mental ill health.\nMethods/design: SCIMITAR+ is a multicentre, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomised controlled trial. We aim to recruit 400 participants aged 18 years and above with a documented diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who smoke. Potentially eligible participants identified in primary or secondary care will be screened, and baseline data collected. Eligible, consenting participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the intervention arm, the participant will be assigned a mental health professional trained to deliver smoking-cessation interventions who will work with the participant and participant's GP or mental health specialist to provide an individually tailored smoking-cessation service. The comparator arm will be usual care - following current NICE guidelines for smoking cessation, in line with general guidance that is offered to all smokers, with no specific adaptation or enhancement in relation to severe mental ill health. The primary outcome will be self-reported smoking cessation at 12 months verified by expired carbon monoxide (CO) measurement. Secondary outcome measures include Body Mass Index at 12 months, the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, Motivation to Quit questionnaire, SF-12, PHQ-9, GAD-7, EQ-5D-5 L, and health service utilisation at 6 and 12 months. The economic evaluation at 12 months will be conducted in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis.\nDiscussion: SCIMITAR+ trial is the largest trial to our knowledge to investigate the effectiveness of a bespoke smoking-cessation service for people with severe mental ill health.\nTrial registration: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number, ISRCTN72955454 .

    "abstract": "Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions for smoking cessation have been shown to be associated with an increase in effectiveness. However, interventions using mobile phones to change people's behaviour are often perceived as complex interventions, and the interactions between several components within them may affect the outcome. Therefore, it is important to understand how we can improve the design of mHealth interventions using mobile phones as a medium to deliver services.\nMethods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions to support smoking cessation or uptake of smoking cessation services for smokers will be included in this systematic review. A search will be performed by searching MEDLINE, MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL. A search for new publications will be conducted 3 months prior to submission for publication as mHealth is an emerging area of research. A random-effects meta-analysis model will be used to summarise the effectiveness of mHealth interventions. The risk ratio will be used for the primary outcome, self-reported or verified smoking abstinence, and any binary outcomes for uptake of smoking cessation services. The standardised mean difference using Hedges' g will be reported for continuous data. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I 2 statistics. Where feasible, meta-regression analysis using random-effects multilevel modelling will be conducted to examine the association of pre-specified characteristics (covariates) at the study level with the effectiveness of interventions. Publication bias will be explored using Egger's test for continuous outcomes and Harbord and Peters tests for dichotomous outcomes. The funnel plot will be used to evaluate the presence of publication bias. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess differences in risks of bias.\nDiscussion: The results of this systematic review will provide future research with a foundation for designing and evaluating complex interventions that use mobile phones as a platform to deliver behaviour change techniques.\nSystematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42016026918 .",

    "title": "Smoking cessation in pulmonary rehabilitation: goal or prerequisite?",
    "abstract": "It has been more than 35 years since the Surgeon General of the United States released the first report of the Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health. Cigarette smoking has been identified as the most important source of preventable morbidity and premature mortality in North America. During the 1990s, tobacco was the largest single cause of premature death in the developed world. Smoking cessation is followed by immediate health benefits in terms of symptoms and organ function. It dramatically reduces the risk of most smoking-related diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Respiratory rehabilitation has been defined as a multidimensional continuum of services directed to persons with pulmonary disease and their families, usually by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, with the goal of achieving and maintaining the individual's maximum level of independence and functioning in the community. A European Respiratory Society task force on rehabilitation recently commented that respiratory rehabilitation must address medical management including reinforcement of smoking cessation, education of the patient and family, exercise reconditioning, physical and occupational therapy, nutritional support, and long-term oxygen therapy. Many patients have quit smoking by the time they enroll in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Nevertheless, the inclusion of smokers in respiratory rehabilitation programs remains controversial. Among 14 trials included in a meta-analysis of respiratory rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the smoking status of the patients was reported in 9 of the trials, and only 2 trials stated that smoking was an absolute exclusion criterion for enrollment. Some investigators have used a trial of smoking cessation as an index of the patient's motivation to improve his or her health status. This article describes the effect of smoking on the course of COPD and the opportunity to address smoking in the context of comprehensive rehabilitation. The authors' line of reasoning is that (1) smoking causes COPD and perpetuates the pathophysiologic processes defining the disease, (2) symptomatic COPD does not facilitate smoking cessation, (3) smoking may alter rehabilitation outcomes, and (4) if smoking cessation is not a prerequisite to pulmonary rehabilitation, then a smoking cessation intervention should at least he offered as part of such a program.",

The full taskforce gathered annually in-person during the Society of Critical Care Medicine Congress for progress reports and further strategizing with the final face-to-face meeting occurring in February 2020. Throughout this process, the Society of Critical Care Medicine standard operating procedures Manual for Guidelines development was adhered to.\nMethods: Taskforce content experts separated into subgroups addressing pain/analgesia, sedation, tolerance/iatrogenic withdrawal, neuromuscular blockade, delirium, PICU environment (family presence and sleep hygiene), and early mobility. Subgroups created descriptive and actionable Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions. An experienced medical information specialist developed search strategies to identify relevant literature between January 1990 and January 2020. Subgroups reviewed literature, determined quality of evidence, and formulated recommendations classified as \"strong\" with \"we recommend\" or \"conditional\" with \"we suggest.\" Good practice statements were used when indirect evidence supported benefit with no or minimal risk. Evidence gaps were noted. Initial recommendations were reviewed by each subgroup and revised as deemed necessary prior to being disseminated for voting by the full taskforce. Individuals who had an overt or potential conflict of interest abstained from relevant votes. Expert opinion alone was not used in substitution for a lack of evidence.\nResults: The Pediatric Pain, Agitation, Neuromuscular Blockade, and Delirium in critically ill pediatric patients with consideration of the PICU Environment and Early Mobility taskforce issued 44 recommendations (14 strong and 30 conditional) and five good practice statements.\nConclusions: The current guidelines represent a comprehensive list of practical clinical recommendations for the assessment, prevention, and management of key aspects for the comprehensive critical care of infants and children. Main areas of focus included 1) need for the routine monitoring of pain, agitation, withdrawal, and delirium using validated tools, 2) enhanced use of protocolized sedation and analgesia, and 3) recognition of the importance of nonpharmacologic interventions for enhancing patient comfort and comprehensive care provision.",

Four electronic databases were searched in December 2018 for articles published in the previous 10 years. Fourteen health outcomes were examined. A total of 41 articles, including 92 340 unique participants from 14 countries, met inclusion criteria. Sleep was assessed objectively in 37% of studies and subjectively in 63% of studies. Findings suggest that later sleep timing and greater sleep variability were generally associated with adverse health outcomes. However, because most studies reported linear associations, it was not possible to identify thresholds for \"late sleep timing\" or \"large sleep variability\". In addition, social jetlag was associated with adverse health outcomes, while weekend catch-up sleep was associated with better health outcomes. The quality of evidence ranged from \"very low\" to \"moderate\" across study designs and health outcomes using GRADE. In conclusion, the available evidence supports that earlier sleep timing and regularity in sleep patterns with consistent bedtimes and wake-up times are favourably associated with health. (PROSPERO registration no.: CRD42019119534.) Novelty This is the first systematic review to examine the influence of sleep timing and sleep consistency on health outcomes. Later sleep timing and greater variability in sleep are both associated with adverse health outcomes in adults.

    "title": "Delirium in critical illness: clinical manifestations, outcomes, and management",
    "abstract": "Delirium is the most common manifestation of brain dysfunction in critically ill patients. In the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of delirium is independently predictive of excess death, length of stay, cost of care, and acquired dementia. There are numerous neurotransmitter/functional and/or injury-causing hypotheses rather than a unifying mechanism for delirium. Without using a validated delirium instrument, delirium can be misdiagnosed (under, but also overdiagnosed and trivialized), supporting the recommendation to use a monitoring instrument routinely. The best-validated ICU bedside instruments are CAM-ICU and ICDSC, both of which also detect subsyndromal delirium. Both tools have some inherent limitations in the neurologically injured patients, yet still provide valuable information about delirium once the sequelae of the primary injury settle into a new post-injury baseline. Now it is known that antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications do not reliably improve brain function in critically ill delirious patients. ICU teams should systematically screen for predisposing and precipitating factors. These include exacerbations of cardiac/respiratory failure or sepsis, metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, dysnatremia, uremia and ammonemia) receipt of psychoactive medications, and sensory deprivation through prolonged immobilization, uncorrected vision and hearing deficits, poor sleep hygiene, and isolation from loved ones so common during COVID-19 pandemic. The ABCDEF (A2F) bundle is a means to facilitate implementation of the 2018 Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS) Guidelines. In over 25,000 patients across nearly 100 institutions, the A2F bundle has been shown in a dose-response fashion (i.e., greater bundle compliance) to yield improved survival, length of stay, coma and delirium duration, cost, and less ICU bounce-backs and discharge to nursing homes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Managing stress and having good quality sleep are inter-related factors that are essential for health, and both factors seem to be affected by physical activity. Although there is an established bidirectional relationship between stress and sleep, remarkably few studies have been designed to examine the effects of physical activity on cortisol, a key biomarker for stress, and sleep. Research is particularly scarce in older people despite both sleep and cortisol changing with age.

Original, peer-reviewed records of intervention studies such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs with relevant control groups were eligible for inclusion. The Participant, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) characteristics were (1) adults or older adults (2) physical activity programmes of any duration, (3) controls receiving no intervention or controls included in a different programme, (4) cortisol measurement, and subjective or objective measures of sleep.\nResults: Ten original studies with low-to-moderate risk of bias were included. Findings from this review indicated with moderate- and low-certainty evidence, respectively, that physical activity was an effective strategy for lowering cortisol levels (SMD [95% CI] = -0.37 [-0.52, -0.21] p < .001) and improving sleep quality (SMD [95% CI] = -0.30 [-0.56, -0.04], p = .02). Caution is needed to generalize these findings to the general population, as included trials were predominantly participants with breast cancer, included few males and no older adults.\nConclusion: Cortisol regulation and sleep quality are intertwined, and physical activity programmes could improve both in several ways. Further, physical activity may benefit adults with long term conditions or current poor (mental) health states the most, although more research is needed to support this claim fully. Few intervention studies have examined the inter-relationship between cortisol and sleep outcomes in males or older adults, indicating fruitful enquiry for future research.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: University students tend to suffer from problems of sleep regularity, quantity and quality, which can affect their academic performance. These problems are related to changes typical of the phase of the life cycle in which they find themselves due to maturational, psychosocial development (associated with the processes of individuation and socialisation) and academic factors. The study of the relationship between sleep and academic performance in university students is an area of research of growing interest, which has started to be studied over the last two decades.\nAim: To conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on the relationship between sleep and academic performance in university students.\nSubjects and methods: The articles included in the PubMed database were selected, following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating samples of subjects with an average age between 18 and 26 years, published in English or Spanish during the period 2000-2019 were included. Subsequently, the quality of the selected articles was evaluated according to the STROBE standard.\nResults: Thirty studies were identified, which were grouped according to different aspects of sleep: drowsiness, duration, experience of total sleep deprivation, sleep quality, chronotype, regularity and sleep disorders.\nConclusion: The results of these studies suggest that inadequate sleep has a negative effect on the academic performance of university students.",

    "abstract": "Study objectives: The unique requirements of shift work, such as sleeping and working at variable times, mean that current sleep hygiene guidelines may be inappropriate for shift workers. Current guidelines may also contradict fatigue management advice (e.g. advising against daytime napping). The present study utilized a Delphi methodology to determine expert opinion regarding the applicability of current guidelines for shift workers, the appropriateness of the term \"sleep hygiene,\" and develop tailored guidelines for shift workers.\nMethods: The research team reviewed current guidelines and existing evidence to draft tailored guidelines. Seventeen individual guidelines, covering sleep scheduling, napping, sleep environment, bedtime routine, substances, light exposure, diet, and exercise were drafted. Experts from sleep, shift work, and occupational health fields (n = 155) were invited to review the draft guidelines using a Delphi methodology. In each round, experts voted on individual guidelines, with 70% agreement considered consensus. Where consensus was not reached, written feedback from experts was discussed and incorporated into subsequent iterations.\nResults: Of the experts invited, 68 (44%) agreed to participate, with 55 (35%) completing the third (final) round. Most experts (84%) agreed that tailored guidelines were required for shift workers. Consensus was reached on all guidelines after three rounds. One additional guideline (sleep inertia) and an introductory statement were developed, resulting in a final set of 18 individual guidelines, termed \"healthy sleep practices for shift workers.\"\nConclusions: This is the first study to develop tailored sleep hygiene guidelines for shift workers. Future research should investigate the acceptability and effectiveness of these guidelines amongst shift workers.",

Affected individuals have higher rates of other mental health disorders, substance use disorders, and comorbid chronic medical illnesses. New diagnostic criteria and specifiers with attention on mixed features and anxious distress aid the physician in recognizing episode severity and prognosis. Physicians should consider bipolar disorder in any patient presenting with depression. Pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers, such as lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics, is a first-line treatment that should be continued indefinitely because of the risk of patient relapse. Active lifestyle approaches include good nutrition, exercise, sleep hygiene, and proper weight management. Monotherapy with antidepressants is contraindicated during episodes with mixed features, manic episodes, and in bipolar I disorder. Ongoing management involves monitoring for suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, treatment adherence, and recognizing medical complications of pharmacotherapy. Psychotherapy is a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Patients and their support systems should be educated about the chronic nature of this illness, possible relapse, suicidality, environmental triggers (e.g., seasonal light changes, shift work, other circadian disruption), and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications.",

    "abstract": "Sleeping problems are prevalent among children and adolescents, often leading to frequent consultations with pediatricians. While cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown effectiveness, especially in the short term, there is a lack of globally endorsed guidelines for the use of pharmaceuticals or over-the-counter remedies in managing sleep onset insomnia. An expert panel of pediatric sleep specialists and chronobiologists met in October 2023 to develop practical recommendations for pediatricians on the management of sleep onset insomnia in typically developing children. When sleep onset insomnia is present in otherwise healthy children, the management should follow a stepwise approach. Practical sleep hygiene indications and adaptive bedtime routine, followed by behavioral therapies, must be the first step. When these measures are not effective, low-dose melatonin, administered 30-60 min before bedtime, might be helpful in children over 2 years old. Melatonin use should be monitored by pediatricians to evaluate the efficacy as well as the presence of adverse effects. Conclusion: Low-dose melatonin is a useful strategy for managing sleep onset insomnia in healthy children who have not improved or have responded insufficiently to sleep hygiene and behavioral interventions.",

People with sleep deficiency are at increased risk for acute illnesses, traumatic sports injuries, and development of chronic diseases. Training sessions or competitions during extremely early or late hours can interfere with circadian and homeostatic rhythms. Adjusting the training schedule to improve sleep duration has a significantly positive impact on several aspects of athletic performance. Pediatricians should increase the time dedicated in well-child visits for sleep hygiene and evaluate for sleep disorders at all ages. Parents, coaching staff, teachers, and pediatricians should advocate for improved education on the importance of sleep during adolescence.

    "abstract": "Importance: Sleep disturbances prevalent among patients with advanced lung cancer can aggravate physical and psychological symptoms, contributing to decreased quality of life and survival.\nObjective: To compare the effectiveness of 2 physical activities of different modalities and intensities, namely aerobic exercise (AE) and tai chi (TC), on subjective sleep quality, physical and psychological outcomes, and survival in patients with advanced lung cancer.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 3 public hospitals in Hong Kong between December 19, 2018, and September 7, 2022. A total of 226 patients with advanced lung cancer were recruited and randomized 1:1:1 to AE, TC, or the control group.\nInterventions: For 16 weeks, the AE group received two 60-minute supervised group exercise sessions and home-based exercises per month, and the TC group received 60-minute group sessions twice weekly. The control group received physical activity guidelines.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was subjective sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included objective sleep measures, anxiety, depression, fatigue, quality of life, physical function, circadian rhythm, and 1-year survival. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 16 weeks (T1), and 1 year (T2).\nResults: The 226 participants had a mean (SD) age of 61.41 (8.73) years, and 122 (54.0%) were female. Compared with the control group, participants in the AE and TC groups showed statistically significant improvements in subjective sleep quality from baseline to T1 (AE: between-group difference, -2.72; 95% CI, -3.97 to -1.46; P < .001; TC: between-group difference, -4.21; 95% CI, -5.48 to -2.94; P < .001) and T2 (AE: between-group difference, -1.75; 95% CI, -3.24 to -0.26; P = .02; TC: between-group difference, -3.95; 95% CI, -5.41 to -2.49; P < .001), psychological distress, physical function, step count, and circadian rhythm. The TC group had a statistically significant greater improvement in sleep than the AE group at T1 (between-group difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.77 to -0.22; P = .02) and T2 (between-group difference, -2.20; 95% CI, -3.57 to -0.83; P < .001). Participants in the TC group showed statistically significant improvement in survival compared with the control group.\nConclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, AE and TC improved sleep, psychological distress, physical function, and circadian rhythm, with TC demonstrating greater benefits on sleep and survival. Both exercises, but particularly TC, can be incorporated into lung cancer survivorship care.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04119778.",

    "title": "Children and Adolescents and Digital Media",
    "abstract": "Today's children and adolescents are immersed in both traditional and new forms of digital media. Research on traditional media, such as television, has identified health concerns and negative outcomes that correlate with the duration and content of viewing. Over the past decade, the use of digital media, including interactive and social media, has grown, and research evidence suggests that these newer media offer both benefits and risks to the health of children and teenagers. Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support, and new opportunities to access health promotion messages and information. Risks of such media include negative health effects on sleep, attention, and learning; a higher incidence of obesity and depression; exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; and compromised privacy and confidentiality. This technical report reviews the literature regarding these opportunities and risks, framed around clinical questions, for children from birth to adulthood. To promote health and wellness in children and adolescents, it is important to maintain adequate physical activity, healthy nutrition, good sleep hygiene, and a nurturing social environment. A healthy Family Media Use Plan (www.healthychildren.org/MediaUsePlan) that is individualized for a specific child, teenager, or family can identify an appropriate balance between screen time/online time and other activities, set boundaries for accessing content, guide displays of personal information, encourage age-appropriate critical thinking and digital literacy, and support open family communication and implementation of consistent rules about media use.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adults.\nMethods: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force evaluated a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically relevant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that underpin the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.\nRecommendations: The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific behavioral and psychological therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adult patients. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength (\"strong\" or \"conditional\"). A \"strong\" recommendation (ie, \"We recommend…\") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A \"conditional\" recommendation is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience, and to strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action. 1. We recommend that clinicians use multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (STRONG). 2. We suggest that clinicians use multicomponent brief therapies for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 3. We suggest that clinicians use stimulus control as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 4. We suggest that clinicians use sleep restriction therapy as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 5. We suggest that clinicians use relaxation therapy as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL). 6. We suggest that clinicians not use sleep hygiene as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL).",

Despite that, the sport context has many factors that can negatively influence athletes' sleep and subsequent recovery.\nObjectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the most recent literature regarding sleep interventions aimed at improving sleep and subsequent performance in athletes.\nMethods: The present systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines and the PICOS approach. The search was conducted in May 2022 using the electronic database PubMed, SPORTDiscus via EBSCOhost, and Web of Science. Once extracted, studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) participants were athletes of individual or team sports; (2) implemented an intervention aimed at improving sleep; (3) measured at least one objective performance/recovery outcome; and (4) reported the relationship between sleep and performance.\nResults: The search returned 1584 records. Following the screening, a total of 25 studies met our inclusion criteria. All the included articles were intervention studies published between 2011 and 2021. The included studies implemented various sleep interventions, such as sleep hygiene, naps, sleep extension, light manipulation, cold water immersion, mindfulness, or a combination of two or more strategies. Sleep extension and naps were the most representative and most effective strategies to improve sleep and performance. Mindfulness and light manipulation demonstrated promising results, but more studies are needed to confirm these findings. Sleep hygiene, removing electronic devices at night, and cold water immersion had no effects on sleep and subsequent performance/recovery, but these results are based on a few studies only.\nConclusion: While acknowledging the limited amount of high-quality evidence reviewed, it appears that increasing sleep duration at night or through napping was the most effective interventions to improve physical and/or cognitive performance.

    "title": "Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms",
    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has surged, with an estimated 1 in 36 eight-year-olds in the United States meeting criteria for ASD in 2020. Autistic individuals face elevated rates of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and behavioral conditions compared to non-autistic individuals. The rising ASD-patient demand is increasingly outpacing the capacity of ASD-specialty clinics, resulting in urgent need for autism-competent providers in general practice settings. This work aims to empower healthcare providers, especially primary care providers (PCPs), with guidelines for the recognition and safe pharmacologic management of common co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in ASD.\nMethods: Lurie Center for Autism medical providers, who have extensive experience in ASD care, delineated approaches for recognition and pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and irritability tailored to ASD patients. Pharmacological guidelines were iteratively refined until consensus was reached. Treatment differences relative to standard of care (SOC) of non-autistic individuals are noted. Key literature and clinical trial results were reviewed to supplement clinical experience.\nResults: The pharmacological treatment pathways reflect how appropriate medication options for ASD patients can depend on many factors unique to the patient and can differ from established non-autistic SOC. Key takeaways include: For sleep disturbances in ASD, initial strategies align with non-autistic SOC, emphasizing sleep hygiene and melatonin use. First-line recommendations for treating ADHD, anxiety, and depression in ASD differ from non-autistic SOC; α2-adrenergic agonists are more suitable than stimulants for some ASD-ADHD patients, buspirone and mirtazapine are preferred to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, and duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, and vortioxetine are recommended ahead of SSRIs for depression. Addressing irritability in ASD requires interdisciplinary evaluation of contributing factors, and guanfacine, risperidone, or aripiprazole may be appropriate, depending on severity.\nConclusions: Recognition and treatment of co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in autistic patients must account for differences in clinical presentation and medication effectiveness and tolerability. Drawing on evidence-based clinical insights, these guidelines seek to support PCPs in making informed decisions when prescribing medications for ASD patients with co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions, ultimately enhancing access to timely, comprehensive care for all individuals with ASD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias are often benign and transient, requiring no formal treatment. However, parasomnias can also be chronic, disrupt sleep quality, and pose a significant risk of harm to the patient or others. Numerous behavioral strategies have been described for the management of NREM parasomnias, but there have been no published comprehensive reviews. This systematic review was conducted to summarize the range of behavioral and psychological interventions and their efficacy.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify all reports of behavioral and psychological treatments for NREM parasomnias (confusional arousals, sexsomnia, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, sleep-related eating disorder, parasomnia overlap disorder). This review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021230360). The search was conducted in the following databases (initially on March 10, 2021 and updated February 24, 2023): Ovid (MEDLINE), Cochrane Library databases (Wiley), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and Web of Science (Clarivate). Given a lack of standardized quantitative outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was used. Risk of bias assessment used tools from Joanna Briggs Institute.\nResults: A total of 72 publications in four languages were included, most of which were case reports (68%) or case series (21%). Children were included in 32 publications and adults in 44. The most common treatment was hypnosis (33 publications) followed by various types of psychotherapy (31), sleep hygiene (19), education/reassurance (15), relaxation (10), scheduled awakenings (9), sleep extension/scheduled naps (9), and mindfulness (5). Study designs and inconsistent outcome measures limited the evidence for specific treatments, but some evidence supports multicomponent CBT, sleep hygiene, scheduled awakenings, and hypnosis.\nConclusions: This review highlights the wide breadth of behavioral and psychological interventions for managing NREM parasomnias. Evidence for the efficacy of these treatments is limited by the retrospective and uncontrolled nature of most research as well as the infrequent use of validated quantitative outcome measures. Behavioral and psychological treatments have been studied alone and in various combinations, and recent publications suggest a trend toward preference for multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapies designed to specifically target priming and precipitating factors of NREM parasomnias.",

Conventional sleep screening and intervention approaches may not be efficacious for athletes given their lifestyle, the demands of training and travel associated with interstate/international competition.\nObjectives: The present systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate sleep intervention studies targeting subsequent performance and recovery in competitive athletes. Based on the findings, a secondary aim was to outline a possible sleep intervention for athletes, including recommendations for content, mode of delivery and evaluation.\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA guidelines in May 2016 with an update completed in September 2017. Ten studies met our inclusion criteria comprising a total of 218 participants in the age range of 18-24 years with athletes from various sports (e.g., swimming, soccer, basketball, tennis).

Bright light therapy (LT) has proven its efficacy in circadian and mood disorders. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines and using the databases Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a special focus on light therapy and insomnia. Twenty-two studies with a total of 685 participants were included, five of which with a high level of proof. Meta-analysis was performed with 13 of them: light therapy for insomnia compared with control conditions significantly improved wake after sleep onset (WASO: SMD = -0.61 [-1.11, -0.11]; p = 0.017; weighted difference of 11.2 min ±11.5 based on actigraphy, and SMD = -1.09 [-1.43, -0.74] (p < 0.001) weighted difference of -36.4 min ±15.05) based on sleep diary, but no other sleep measures such as sleep latency, total sleep time (TST), or sleep efficiency. Qualitative analysis of the review showed some improvement mainly in subjective measures. Morning light exposure advanced sleep-wake rhythms and evening exposure led to a delay. No worsening was observed in objective nor subjective measures, except for TST in one study with evening exposure. A light dose-response may exist but the studies' heterogeneity and publication bias limit the interpretation. To conclude, light therapy shows some effectiveness for sleep maintenance in insomnia disorders, but further research is needed to refine the light parameters to be chosen according to the type of insomnia, in the hope of developing personalised therapeutics.",

Both groups received sleep hygiene guidelines before the intervention and weekly follow-up during it. Evaluations were performed before and after intervention. All statistical analyses and intention-to-treat test were performed in SPSS 22. Sleep quality (Primary outcome) was measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcomes were polysomnography data, severity of insomnia, anxiety and depression symptoms, and postmenopausal symptoms.\nResults: There were no significant differences between groups after intervention in the primary outcome (P = 0.22; effect size=0.69); however, a tendency of improvement in wake after sleep onset (WASO) was observed (P = 0.07; effect size=0.81; B = 42.2). Both groups presented better sleep quality over time (AG P < 0.001; PG P = 0.011). AG participants showed a significant decrease in sleep onset latency (P = 0.001), depression levels (P = 0.025), hot flashes (P < 0.001), postmenopausal symptoms (P < 0.001) and, in polysomnography data, increased sleep efficiency (P = 0.002) compared to baseline.\nConclusion: Although no significant differences were observed between groups, our data presented a tendency of improvement in WASO. Moreover, AG participants had enhanced overall sleep pattern, quality and sleep efficiency. Weekly follow-up and sleep hygiene instructions were essential for both groups to show improvement in almost all outcomes.\nClinical trial registration: Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br, RBR-5q5t5z.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Sleep is one of the issues that attracted the attention of researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers focused their studies on the prevalence of sleep disorders, sleep quality, and sleep duration. Sleep hygiene is a set of guidelines that play an important role in the sleep quality, the present study sought to evaluate the amount of sleep hygiene and sleep quality in Iranian adolescents and their relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods: The present study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. The research population consisted of all adolescents living in Kermanshah (western Iran) in 2021. The participants were a sample of 610 adolescents. They completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory and Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale.\nResults: The mean sleep quality score for the participants was 7.14 ± 2.47, indicating the high frequency of sleep problems affecting the participants. There were significant correlations between all components of sleep hygiene and sleep quality. There was also a significant correlation (r = - 0.46 between sleep hygiene and sleep quality (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in sleep hygiene and sleep quality between the male and female adolescents. The results showed that sleep hygiene subscales can predict sleep quality (R = 0.53, F = 39.20, p < .01).\nConclusions: The data in this study confirmed the poor observance of sleep hygiene in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and reported frequent sleep problems among the participants. The results also indicated a moderate relationship between sleep hygiene and sleep quality in adolescents. Thus, sleep hygiene components can be related to sleep quality.",

    "title": "Sleep hygiene in shift workers: A systematic literature review",
    "abstract": "In response to demand for the '24/7' service availability, shift work has become increasingly common. Given their non-traditional working hours, shift workers sleep at non-traditional times, with significant research undertaken to understand shift worker sleep. However, sleep hygiene in shift workers has been paid little research attention. To investigate shift worker engagement with sleep hygiene, a systematic review using the databases Sage, ScienceDirect, and Scopus was undertaken. The search terms utilised were: shift work, shiftwork, shift-work, sleep hygiene, sleep routine, and sleep habit. Sixteen studies were included for review. Findings show that shift workers frequently report caffeine consumption and daytime napping, in line with best-practice fatigue-management strategies, but contrary to existing sleep hygiene recommendations. Shift workers also altered their bedroom environment to optimise sleep. Diet, exercise, alcohol and nicotine consumption were investigated minimally from a sleep hygiene perspective. Given that shift workers are engaging in practices in-line with current fatigue-management strategies, but contrary to sleep hygiene recommendations, further research is required. Specifically, assessment of the applicability of current sleep hygiene guidelines to shift workers (particularly caffeine and napping recommendations) is required, in addition to the development of shift work-specific sleep hygiene guidelines and interventions for this sleep-vulnerable population.",

However, strenuous evening exercise may disrupt sleep due to heightened sympathetic arousal. This study examines the association between strenuous evening exercise and objective sleep, using data from 14,689 physically active individuals who wore a biometric device during a one-year study interval (4,084,354 person-nights). Here we show later exercise timing and higher exercise strain are associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, higher nocturnal resting heart rate, and lower nocturnal heart rate variability. Regardless of strain, exercise bouts ending ≥4 hours before sleep onset are not associated with changes in sleep. Our results suggest evening exercise-particularly involving high exercise strain-may disrupt subsequent sleep and nocturnal autonomic function. Individuals aiming to improve sleep health may benefit from concluding exercise at least 4 hours before sleep onset or electing lighter strain exercises within this window.",

    "abstract": "Background: This paper explores the widely discussed relationship between electronic media use and sleep quality, indicating negative effects due to various factors. However, existing meta-analyses on the topic have some limitations.\nObjective: The study aims to analyze and compare the impacts of different digital media types, such as smartphones, online games, and social media, on sleep quality.\nMethods: Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the study performed a systematic meta-analysis of literature across multiple databases, including Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar, from January 2018 to October 2023. Two trained coders coded the study characteristics independently. The effect sizes were calculated using the correlation coefficient as a standardized measure of the relationship between electronic media use and sleep quality across studies. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 3.0) was used to perform the meta-analysis. Statistical methods such as funnel plots were used to assess the presence of asymmetry and a p-curve test to test the p-hacking problem, which can indicate publication bias.\nResults: Following a thorough screening process, the study involved 55 papers (56 items) with 41,716 participants from over 20 countries, classifying electronic media use into \"general use\" and \"problematic use.\" The meta-analysis revealed that electronic media use was significantly linked with decreased sleep quality and increased sleep problems with varying effect sizes across subgroups. A significant cultural difference was also observed in these effects. General use was associated with a significant decrease in sleep quality (P<.001). The pooled effect size was 0.28 (95% CI 0.21-0.35; k=20). Problematic use was associated with a significant increase in sleep problems (P≤.001). The pooled effect size was 0.33 (95% CI 0.28-0.38; k=36). The subgroup analysis indicated that the effect of general smartphone use and sleep problems was r=0.33 (95% CI 0.27-0.40), which was the highest among the general group. The effect of problematic internet use and sleep problems was r=0.51 (95% CI 0.43-0.59), which was the highest among the problematic groups. There were significant differences among these subgroups (general: Qbetween=14.46, P=.001; problematic: Qbetween=27.37, P<.001). The results of the meta-regression analysis using age, gender, and culture as moderators indicated that only cultural difference in the relationship between Eastern and Western culture was significant (Qbetween=6.69; P=.01). All funnel plots and p-curve analyses showed no evidence of publication and selection bias.\nConclusions: Despite some variability, the study overall confirms the correlation between increased electronic media use and poorer sleep outcomes, which is notably more significant in Eastern cultures.",

    "title": "Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2",
    "abstract": "Clinical characteristics: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is characterized by myotonia and muscle dysfunction (proximal and axial weakness, myalgia, and stiffness), and less commonly by posterior subcapsular cataracts, cardiac conduction defects, insulin-insensitive type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other endocrine abnormalities. While myotonia (involuntary muscle contraction with delayed relaxation) has been reported during the first decade, onset is typically in the third to fourth decade, most commonly with fluctuating or episodic muscle pain that can be debilitating and proximal and axial weakness of the neck flexors and the hip flexors. Subsequently, weakness occurs in the elbow extensors and finger flexors. Facial weakness and weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors are less common. Myotonia rarely causes severe symptoms. In a subset of individuals, calf hypertrophy in combination with brisk reflexes is notable.\nDiagnosis/testing: The diagnosis of DM2 is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic expansion of a CCTG repeat within the complex repeat motif of (TG)n(TCTG)n(CCTG)n(TCTG')n in CNBP. The number of CCTG repeats in a pathogenic expansion ranges from approximately 75 to more than 11,000, with a mean of approximately 5,000 repeats. The detection rate of a CNBP CCTG expansion is more than 99% with the combination of routine PCR, Southern blot analysis, and PCR repeat-primed assay.\nManagement: Treatment of manifestations: Ankle-foot orthoses, wheelchairs, or other assistive devices as needed for weakness; regular physical activity and exercise training appears to help maintain muscle strength and endurance and to control musculoskeletal pain; myotonia, especially of the legs, can require treatment and mexiletine or lamotrigine may be beneficial; medications used with some success in myalgia management include mexiletine, gabapentin, pregabalin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cannabinoids, low-dose thyroid replacement, and tricyclic antidepressants; removal of cataracts or epiretinal membrane that impair vision; education regarding sleep hygiene; cognitive behavioral therapy and modafinil may be helpful for fatigue and daytime sleepiness; vitamin D supplementation for those with deficiency; treatment of diabetes and or dietary management per endocrinologist for insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes; lipid-lowering drugs for hyperlipidemia; hormone therapy for endocrine dysfunction; hearing aids for sensorineural hearing loss; treatment of arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy per cardiologist with defibrillator placement for those with arrhythmias; prokinetic agents may be helpful for gastrointestinal manifestations; vaccinations, respiratory training, and cough assist with noninvasive ventilation as needed; cognitive behavioral therapy and psychotropic medications as needed; standard treatment per oncologist for any cancers.\nSurveillance: Annual evaluation with neurologist, occupational therapist, and physical therapist; annual ophthalmology evaluation for posterior subcapsular cataracts and epiretinal membranes; assessment for sleep issues, polysomnography to identify sleep apnea, and serum vitamin D every six months; annual assessment of body mass index, clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disorders; measurement of fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin level, thyroid hormone levels, and lipid panel annually; serum testosterone, inhibin B, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and dehydroeipandosterone sulfate annually in males; audiometry evaluation every six months; annual assessment for palpitations, syncope, dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema; annual EKG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and echocardiogram to detect/monitor cardiac conduction defects and cardiomyopathy; cardiac MRI per cardiologist; assess for gastrointestinal manifestations and respiratory issues using the Respicheck assessment annually; pulmonary function test, cough peak flow, and nocturnal oximetry/capnometry annually; assessment of cardiac and respiratory function before and after surgery; assess for learning difficulties, memory deficits, executive dysfunction, and affective disorders as clinically indicated; neuropsychological testing and brain MRI as clinically indicated; annual assessment for clinical manifestations of associated tumors and follow standard population tumor screening guidelines.\nAgents/circumstances to avoid: Cholesterol-lowering medications when associated with increased weakness; medications that can exacerbate myotonia (depolarizing muscle relaxants). Monitor ventilation before, during, and after anesthesia.\nGenetic counseling: DM2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals whose biological parents have been evaluated with molecular genetic testing have had a parent with a pathogenic CNBP CCTG repeat expansion; de novo pathogenic CCTG repeat expansions have not been reported. Each child of an individual with a CCTG repeat expansion has a 50% chance of inheriting the expansion. The CCTG repeat expansion shows size differences between generations in the same family. In general, the repeat size appears to contract when passed on to the subsequent generation and then to increase in size as the affected individual ages. There is no confirmed maternal or paternal preference for contraction or expansion. Anticipation is not confirmed in DM2. To date, there is no significant correlation between CCTG repeat size and age of onset of weakness or other measures of disease severity. Once the pathogenic CNBP CCTG repeat expansion has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

    "abstract": "Pain is the predominant symptom for people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) and osteoarthritis (OA) mandating the development of evidence-based recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management. A multidisciplinary task force including professionals and patient representatives conducted a systematic literature review of systematic reviews to evaluate evidence regarding effects on pain of multiple treatment modalities. Overarching principles and recommendations regarding assessment and pain treatment were specified on the basis of reviewed evidence and expert opinion. From 2914 review studies initially identified, 186 met inclusion criteria. The task force emphasised the importance for the health professional to adopt a patient-centred framework within a biopsychosocial perspective, to have sufficient knowledge of IA and OA pathogenesis, and to be able to differentiate localised and generalised pain. Treatment is guided by scientific evidence and the assessment of patient needs, preferences and priorities; pain characteristics; previous and ongoing pain treatments; inflammation and joint damage; and psychological and other pain-related factors. Pain treatment options typically include education complemented by physical activity and exercise, orthotics, psychological and social interventions, sleep hygiene education, weight management, pharmacological and joint-specific treatment options, or interdisciplinary pain management. Effects on pain were most uniformly positive for physical activity and exercise interventions, and for psychological interventions. Effects on pain for educational interventions, orthotics, weight management and multidisciplinary treatment were shown for particular disease groups. Underpinned by available systematic reviews and meta-analyses, these recommendations enable health professionals to provide knowledgeable pain-management support for people with IA and OA.",

    "abstract": "Aims: The main aim of the present review was to update the available evidence on the value interest of post-competition recovery strategies in male professional or semi-professional soccer players to determine its effect on post-game performance outcomes, physiological markers, and wellness indicators.\nMethods: A structured search was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines using six online databases: Pubmed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The risk of bias was completed following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were conducted to determine the between and within-group effects of different recovery strategies on performance, physiological markers and wellness data. Final meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model and pooled standardized mean differences (SMD).\nResults: Five randomized controlled trials that used Compression Garments (n = 3), Cold Water Immersion (n = 1), and acute Sleep Hygiene Strategy (n = 1) were included. Greater CMJ values at 48h for the intervention group (SMD = 0.70; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.25; p = 0.001; I2 = 10.4%) were found. For the 20-m sprint and MVC, the results showed no difference either at 24h or 48h. For physiological markers (CK and CRP) and wellness data (DOMS), small to large SMD were present in favor of the intervention group both at 24h (-0.12 to -1.86) and 48h (-0.21 to -0.85). No heterogeneity was present, except for MVC at 24h (I2 = 90.4%; p = 0.0012) and CALF DOMS at 48h (I2 = 93.7%; p = 0.013).\nConclusion: The use of recovery strategies offers significant positive effects only in jumping performance (CMJ), with no effects on the 20-m sprint or MVC. Also, the use of recovery strategies offers greater positive effects on muscle damage (physiological markers and wellness data), highlighting the importance of post-match recovery strategies in soccer.",

Whether irregular schedules independently predict adverse health outcomes remains unclear.\nObjective: To synthesize evidence on the association between objectively or diary-quantified sleep regularity and mental, cardiometabolic, inflammatory, cognitive, lifestyle, sleep-disorder, and mortality outcomes in adults.\nMethods: A protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251101936) guided the review. MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to July 1, 2025 using a comprehensive strategy incorporating validated regularity metrics (Sleep Regularity Index, interdaily stability, composite phase deviation, social jetlag, night-to-night standard deviations). After duplicate removal, 3140 unique records underwent title/abstract screening; 147 full texts were reviewed. Risk of bias was appraised with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity of metrics and outcomes precluded meta-analysis; evidence was synthesized narratively following SWiM guidelines and graded with van Tulder's best-evidence taxonomy.\nResults: Fifty-nine primary studies met all criteria. Consistent, moderate-certainty evidence linked greater sleep-timing irregularity to higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, elevated body mass index, insulin resistance, hypertension, and incident cardiovascular events. Limited but directionally uniform evidence indicated higher inflammatory markers and poorer lifestyle indices in irregular sleepers. Prospective biobank data associated low Sleep Regularity Index with smaller hippocampal volume and a 26-53 % increase in dementia risk. Five low-bias cohorts showed 20-88 % higher all-cause mortality for the least regular sleepers, independent of sleep duration and quality. Mechanistic pathways implicated circadian misalignment, autonomic imbalance, and systemic inflammation.\nConclusions: Across diverse populations and measurement approaches, unstable sleep timing consistently portends poorer mental, metabolic, vascular, cognitive, and survival outcomes. Because sleep regularity is modifiable and objectively trackable with wearables, schedule stabilization merits elevation to a core public-health recommendation and a priority target for randomized intervention trials.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess physical activity and sleep rates in a cohort of children with epilepsy (CWE) and determine if there is a relationship between physical activity and sleep time.\nMethods: Children aged 8-14 years with a diagnosis of epilepsy and at least one seizure in the past 12 months were monitored via a wrist-worn activity tracker for 16 weeks, to objectively measure daily physical activity, as assessed by step counts, and sleep time. Adherence to physical activity (≥12,000 steps/day) and sleep recommendations (≥9 h for children aged 8-12 years, or ≥8 h for children aged 13-15 years) was determined. To predict daily activity or nightly sleep, a series of multivariable models incorporating age, sex, day-type (all combinations of weekday or weekend and summer holiday or school), participant (as a random effect), daily physical activity (for models predicting sleep), nightly sleep (for models predicting physical activity), and autoregressive terms of previous sleep or physical activity were constructed, and the best-performing models were selected with Akaike information criterion analysis.\nResults: Twenty-two children with mild to moderate epilepsy were recruited (54.5% female, median (IQR) age 11 (10, 13) years) and monitored for 16 weeks. They met the recommended level of physical activity only in 38.0% (21.7%, 59.4%), and sleep in 49.1% (30.0%, 68.5%) of days. They met both physical activity and sleep guidelines on the same day in only 17.8% (95% CI 7.1%, 38.0%). There was no association between meeting the recommended levels of daily physical activity and sleep time (p = 0.86, ρ = 0.03). In the best-performing model, age, sex, day type, and participant explained 28.9% of the variance in daily physical activity, with no additional insight provided by measures of sleep time. Age, sex, day type, participant, and daily physical activity explained 17.3% of the variance in nightly sleep time, with a statistically discernable but small association between physical activity and sleep time (1.79 ± 0.53, p = 0.001).\nConclusion: Our cohort of children with mild to moderate epilepsy showed poor adherence to sleep and physical activity guidelines. There was no clinically relevant association between daily physical activity and sleep among these children who were similarly active to healthy peers. Future studies should assess the effect of increased sleep hygiene and physical activity on overall well-being and seizure control in CWE.",

    "title": "Pediatric Sarcopenia: What do We Know?",
    "abstract": "Pediatric sarcopenia is an emerging health issue that affects muscle development, strength, and overall well-being in children and adolescents. While it was initially linked to aging, recent studies highlight its presence in younger populations, particularly among those with chronic conditions. This condition affects growth and neurodevelopment in the short term and is associated with an increased risk of long-term complications, namely metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Several factors contribute to pediatric sarcopenia, including inadequate prenatal nutrition, low birth weight, genetic susceptibility, insufficient dietary protein intake, sedentary behaviors, obesity, metabolic imbalances, and chronic illnesses. Reduced muscle mass impairs bone health, delays growth spurts, and affects physical performance, which may result in a lower quality of life. In children with chronic diseases, sarcopenia exacerbates clinical outcomes, prolongs hospital stays, and increases the likelihood of complications. Diagnosing sarcopenia in children is complex due to differing growth patterns. Existing assessment methods, such as imaging techniques and body composition analysis, lack standardized reference values tailored to pediatric populations, which makes early detection challenging. Preventive strategies emphasize physical activity, especially resistance exercises (muscle strengthening), reduced screen time, improved dietary habits, and sleep hygiene. Innovative treatments are being explored, including targeted drug delivery to the muscle to minimize side effects, regenerative approaches utilizing nanoparticles, and myostatin inhibitors for stimulating muscle growth. Stem cell therapy and biomaterial-based muscle reconstruction are also under investigation; however, pediatric-specific therapeutic guidelines remain undefined. Early intervention is crucial for reducing its negative effects and fostering healthier developmental paths.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Although parents recognize the importance of sleep, most have a limited understanding of children's sleep needs. This study examined whether parental expectations about sleep were linked to children and adolescent's sleep duration and sleep hygiene.\nMethod: Participants included 376 unique parent-child dyads. Parents (mean age = 47.0 years, SD = 6.7) estimated the number of hours of sleep their children (mean age = 13.0 years, SD = 2.2; 9-17 years) needed. These estimates were age-matched with recommended pediatric guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the National Sleep Foundation to yield 3 groups: expect less (8%-11%), expect appropriate (85%-89%), and expect more (3%-4%). Sleep duration for school nights and weekends were reported by children and parents. Sleep hygiene included sleep-promoting practices (quiet, dark bedroom, regular bed/wake times, consistent routine) and sleep-interfering practices (physiological arousal, presleep worry, alcohol/smoking intake, daytime napping, screen time).\nResults: Most parents (68.7%) endorsed that children do not get enough sleep. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of parental expectations. For every additional hour of sleep expected, children slept between 15.5 (parent-report 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0-22.0) and 17.9 minutes (child-report 95% CI, 9.7-26.2) longer on school nights, adjusted for age, sex, puberty, and parental education. For parents who expected less sleep than recommended, their children had the shortest sleep duration, least favorable sleeping environments, and greater presleep worry.\nConclusion: Parental sleep expectations were directly linked to children's sleep duration. Pediatricians and primary care providers can mobilize knowledge to optimally convey accurate information about developmental sleep needs and recommended hours to parents to promote longer sleep.",

    "abstract": "Sleep hygiene (SH) refers to a list of behaviors, environmental conditions, and other sleep-related factors that can be adjusted as a stand-alone treatment or component of multimodal treatment for patients with insomnia. This paper presents a review of SH, how this concept has been applied and often modified over the past 24 years, and how it relates to the modern sleep disorder nosology, particularly Inadequate Sleep Hygiene. Although a recognized and commonly utilized treatment option, there is no absolute consensus about which steps must be included to constitute SH treatment, and there is much overlap between SH and other cognitive-behavioral treatments for insomnia such as Stimulus Control Procedures and Sleep Restriction Therapy. The literature on the effects of manipulations of individual components of SH under experimental conditions (e.g. effects of presleep alcohol or caffeine intake) in normal sleepers show mixed results. Empirical data demonstrating the role of poor SH as a contributor to insomnia, or showing that good SH improves sleep in patients with insomnia, is not available. Instead of evaluating the impact of a comprehensive list of SH recommendations, a focus on guidelines for use of individual rules is needed.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the position statement of the World Sleep Society (WSS) International Guidelines Committee regarding the Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Behavioral and Psychological Treatments for Chronic Insomnia Disorder in Adults prepared by a task force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The practice guidelines were reviewed for their relevance and applicability to the practice of sleep medicine around the world. The WSS Work Group endorsed the AASM strong recommendation for Multicomponent Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as the treatment of choice for Insomnia Disorder and conditional endorsement for its single-therapy components (sleep restriction, stimulus control, relaxation); use of sleep hygiene education as single therapy was not endorsed due to lack of evidence for its efficacy. The strong recommendation for multicomponent CBT-I applied to patients with chronic insomnia disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions. Main caveats with regard to CBT-I remains the lack of adequately trained therapists and variability in terms of training available in different parts of the world. Unanswered questions about the applicability, availability, accessibility and potential sociodemographic (age, sex, ethnicity, regions) moderators of treatment outcomes were discussed. Despite growing evidence documenting the benefits of digital CBT-I, individual, in-person CBT-I delivered by a trained professional (mental health) provider is regarded as the optimal method to deliver CBT-I.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem. The impact of TBI on the individual is multifaceted and includes neurocognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric disturbances as well as greater predisposition for dementia. A common but significant problem reported by patients after TBI is sleep disturbance. The purpose of this manuscript is twofold: (1) to describe our experience with implementation of the newly developed sleep hygiene guidelines; and (2) to report our preliminary results of implementation of the sleep hygiene guidelines on TBI patient outcomes.\nMethods: A mixed methods approach was used to assess implementation of sleep hygiene guidelines and to gather preliminary data on outcomes.\nResults: Although not statistically significant, the average self-reported sleep duration of these TBI patients was slightly higher in 2010 than 2009, with a FIM score that was similar for both time points. In 2009, the mean change in functional independence measure (FIM) score (n = 34) was 1.44. In 2010, the mean change in FIM score (n = 33) was 1.42. In 2009, most patients (n = 13) admitted to the hospital continued to take medications and were discharged with a sleep aid. In 2010, most patients reported a change in their sleep medication prescriptions (on medications at admission and none at discharge) or had continued to take their prescribed sleep medications from admission to discharge (n = 12).\nConclusion: Sleep disorders have a major impact on health outcomes in patients with TBI. To optimize rehabilitation and ultimately improve functional outcomes of patients with TBI, implementation of evidence-based clinical guidelines for sleep is imperative. We report our initial experience with implementation of sleep guidelines.",

    "title": "Healthy Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Sleep Hygiene to Promote Cardiometabolic Health of Airline Pilots: A Narrative Review",
    "abstract": "Background: Airline pilots experience unique occupational demands that may contribute to adverse physical and psychological health outcomes. Epidemiological reports have shown a substantial prevalence of cardiometabolic health risk factors including excessive body weight, elevated blood pressure, poor lifestyle behaviors, and psychological fatigue. Achieving health guidelines for lifestyle behavior nutrition, physical activity, and sleep are protective factors against the development of noncommunicable diseases and may mitigate the unfavorable occupational demands of airline pilots. This narrative review examines occupational characteristics for sleep, nutrition, and physical activity and outlines evidence-based strategies to inform health behavior interventions to mitigate cardiometabolic health risk factors among airline pilots.\nMethods: Literature sources published between 1990 and 2022 were identified through electronic searches in PubMed, MEDLINE (via OvidSP), PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases, and a review of official reports and documents from regulatory authorities pertaining to aviation medicine and public health was conducted. The literature search strategy comprised key search terms relating to airline pilots, health behaviors, and cardiometabolic health. The inclusion criteria for literature sources were peer-reviewed human studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and reports or documents published by regulatory bodies.\nResults: The results of the review show occupational factors influencing nutrition, sleep, and physical activity behaviors and delineate evident occupational disruptions to these lifestyle behaviors. Evidence from clinical trials demonstrates the efficacy of nutrition, sleep, and physical activity interventions for enhancing the cardiometabolic health of airline pilots.\nConclusion: This narrative review suggests that implementing evidence-based interventions focused on nutrition, physical activity, and sleep could help mitigate cardiometabolic health risk factors among airline pilots, who are particularly susceptible to adverse health outcomes due to unique occupational demands.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The signs and symptoms, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, and options and guidelines for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are reviewed.\nSummary: RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in 1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population. Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-30% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms.\nConclusion: RLS is a common disorder thought to involve abnormal iron metabolism and dopaminergic systems. Nonpharmacologic therapy should be suggested for all patients with RLS, but pharmacologic therapy may be required, and evidence is strongest for levodopa and dopamine agonists.",

The cross-sectional survey was conducted via computer-assisted telephone interview. The survey assessed parent and child demographic characteristics and parent-reported child sleep duration, quality and sleep hygiene practices.\nResults: A total of 488 eligible parents or guardians took part in the study. Parents reported that children slept an average of 11.03 h per night. Approximately 96% of children met daily sleep duration recommendations from sleep guidelines for their age group. The majority of parents reported that their child had 'good' sleep quality (86.89%). Almost 40% reported that their child woke at least once a night. Sleep hygiene practices were relatively well established; however, a small proportion of parents indicated that they had no rules surrounding bedtime (13.52%) or television use before bed (14.52%).\nConclusions: The current study describes the sleep duration, quality and sleep hygiene practices of a sample of pre-school-aged children in New South Wales, Australia. Future research using objective measures of sleep duration and hygiene, as well as assessing a broader spectrum of sleep hygiene practices, is needed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how sleep affects the glymphatic system and human brain networks is crucial for elucidating the neurophysiological mechanism underpinning aging-related memory declines. We analyzed a multimodal dataset collected through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and polysomnographic recording from 72 older adults. A proxy of the glymphatic functioning was obtained from the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index. Structural and functional brain networks were constructed based on MRI data, and coupling between the two networks (SC-FC coupling) was also calculated. Correlation analyses revealed that DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with sleep quality measures [e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and apnea-hypopnea index]. Regarding human brain networks, DTI-ALPS was associated with the strength of both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) involving regions such as the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as with the SC-FC coupling of rich-club connections. Furthermore, we found that DTI-ALPS positively mediated the association between sleep quality and rich-club SC-FC coupling. The rich-club SC-FC coupling further mediated the association between DTI-ALPS and memory function in good sleepers but not in poor sleepers. The results suggest a disrupted glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline. Our findings add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships and the interplay between the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Sleep quality, quantity and timing have been shown to impact glycaemic control, with a role in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and HbA1C levels, in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. The aim of this study was to identify recommendations for sleep assessment and management in international clinical practice guidelines focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus management in adults.\nStudy design: Systematic Review.\nMethodology: Clinical practice guidelines which focused on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults were included (n = 35). Two independent reviewers utilised the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool (AGREE) II and a third reviewer resolved any disagreements. Included guidelines were assessed for recommendations about sleep in diabetes management (n = 14). Data were extracted on sleep recommendations ,themes were generated from the extracted data and narrative syntheses were created.\nResults: From 1114 identified papers, 35 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen of these guidelines included recommendations pertaining to sleep, which broadly fell into five categories; sleep assessment, sleep as a therapeutic target, sleep and co-morbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus, shift work and sleep and driving. Recommendations varied across guidelines.\nConclusion: Few guidelines provided recommendations relating to assessment and management of sleep in type 2 diabetes care. Most of the recommendations were related to obstructive sleep apnoea. However, few guidelines discussed sleep as a therapeutic intervention for diabetes mellitus or described the potential importance of sleep quality and duration in glycaemic control.

    "abstract": "The present article explores the connection between insomnia and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), focusing on the efficacy and safety of melatonin treatments as supported by existing research and current guidelines. In this narrative review a group of Italian experts provide an analysis of the various aspects of managing insomnia in children with ASD, highlighting key points that could enhance the quality of life for both patients and their caregivers. This includes the significance of comprehensively understanding the root causes of a child's sleep difficulties for more effective, long-term management. Insomnia, a condition frequently documented in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD, greatly affects the lives of patients and caregivers. Recent data show that melatonin-based formulations are effective and safe for treating ASD-related insomnia both short and long term. In particular, prolonged-release melatonin is poised to be the optimal choice for this patient population. This formulation is approved for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents aged 2-18 years suffering from ASD and/or Smith-Magenis syndrome, where sleep hygiene measures and behavioral treatments have not been sufficient. In support, emerging research in pediatric settings indicates long-term efficacy and safety, although further research efforts are still needed. Current guidelines recommend managing insomnia and sleep disturbances in ASD using a combination of behavioral and pharmacological methods, primarily melatonin. Recent concerns about accidental melatonin ingestion highlight the need for high purity standards, such as pharmaceutical-grade prolonged-release formulations. The article also summarizes emerging molecular mechanisms from preclinical research, suggesting future therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Background: Childhood obesity represents a major public health issue worldwide. Evidence showed the need to implement prevention strategies mainly focused on lifestyle habits. Sleep hygiene is a variable of great interest and this review systematically examined the effects of sleep duration in increasing childhood obesity risk.\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted from December 2023 to February 2024. Study selection and data extraction procedures were performed in accordance with Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and Statement, and risk of publication bias was assessed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.\nResults: Original works in English were eligible for review and eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria were included. Studies collected were heterogeneous in terms of duration, sample characteristics, hours of sleep manipulation, anthropometric and hematological parameters collected, therefore it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. A narrative synthesis of the reported evidence highlighted the impact of sleep duration above all on food intake, eating habits and hormone levels and consequently on the risk of childhood obesity development.\nConclusion: This finding suggests the need to consider sleep hygiene as a modifiable lifestyle habit like diet and physical activity, in order to early prevent childhood obesity. Poor sleep hygiene can significantly contribute to weight gain and exacerbation of metabolic disorders linked to childhood obesity. Although more rigorous studies are needed, clinicians need to be aware of the role of sleep hygiene in reducing childhood obesity risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common complication of pregnancy, affecting an estimated 16.7% of live births worldwide, which translates to approximately 21 million cases annually. Although poor sleep quality is a prevalent concern in this population, most existing studies predominantly focus on the impact of sleep disorders on GDM, rather than directly assessing sleep quality in women diagnosed with GDM. This study aimed to investigate sleep quality and its associated factors specifically among women with GDM.\nMethods: We originally aimed to include 287 women with GDM; ultimately, 618 were invited, of whom 393 participated in the survey through a convenience sampling method at the obstetric clinics of four general tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China, from June to August 2022. Data were collected utilizing sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Sleep Hygiene Scale, and the Pregnancy-related Anxiety Scale (PrAS). We employed linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with sleep quality.\nResults: The PSQI score of participants was (5.83 ± 3.41). Notably, 43.77% of participants reported an actual sleep duration of less than 8 h per night, whereas 45.55% experienced poor sleep quality. Worrying during the day about your inability to fall asleep (β = 0.204, P < 0.01), body image concern (β = 0.159, P < 0.01), going to bed thirsty (β = 0.160, P < 0.01), educational attainment (β=-0.150, P < 0.01), avoidance (β = 0.124, P < 0.01), sleep disturbed by bed partner's sleep (β = 0.126, P < 0.01), and worrying as you prepare for bed about your inability to fall asleep (β = 0.137, P < 0.05) significantly affected the sleep quality of participants.\nConclusions: The study revealed a high prevalence of insufficient sleep duration and poor sleep quality among women with GDM, which was significantly influenced by inadequate sleep hygiene habits and pregnancy-related anxiety. These findings enhance our understanding of the factors affecting sleep quality in this population and underscore the necessity for healthcare professionals to timely identify sleep disorders. Implementing appropriate interventions, such as the development of educational programs focused on sleep hygiene and body image acceptance through cognitive behavioral therapy, could enhance the quality of care for women with GDM.",
